[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Young nigga, young nigga I'll rather be richer

Call up the plug no Santa, but he sending trees and gas for Christmas
Whippin' the dope, I terminate it, J's they say it's delicious

And after she water whip it, I make that bitch was the dishes
Back to the Fisker, I'm doing 250, I'm praying I don't get a ticket
Yes I'm a Migo, but I don't wear Dickies, I'll rather put on True Religion
And if you want fame over money my nigga, then you not true to your religion
I'll rather be rich, cause it's some niggas that's famous that ain't got shit.

No Offset no preacher, but you niggas listen
Them blue and white diamonds dey look like the Pistons
Codeine sippin, Versace I'm gripping them bands in my pocket
You know that I'm living

Rockin handcuffs, that's Ferragamo
Bricks by the boat, overload

Pull out that KLAW, know they gone feel me
Whippin that Brittney, that Whitney, That Lidnsey
Like I'm a chemist, treat em like dentist

Maybe tonight, but ain't got a session
I hate to be you cause I know it's depressing
Must think it's upsetting the way that I'm dressing
I walk up in Neiman, I see it I cop it
I pull out my pocket, you pull out your wallet
Who you impressing, you know you ain't got it
Diggin through pockets, changing the topic
Nigga just stop it, it hurt me to see you ain't got it
Make me wanna come out my pocket
I'm a get it back cause a nigga got a sack, so my lil' double cup got full of the act
Young nigga got bricksquad, we crack

It's a brand new day, in a brand new whip, and a brand new 45 sittin in my lap

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Aye hold up Takeoff, you see that nigga
It's a brand new nigga on the block, hit his ass with a brand new Glock
Knock em off the block like he playing hopscotch
My niggas is crazy, we keep the new babies
We ride in Mercedes keep crack like the 80s
They cook it, they whippin, they slavin
I 'round the city screaming "Mama we made it"
I'm busting them bricks out the wrapper
Too hot for a trapper, so now I'm a rapper
My pot too big, got too much water, so I skrt-skrt with a broke paddle
I see you running with the sack,
Quavo the linebacker so I had to make the tackle
Got Migos in Mexico right now, putting 50 bricks on a horse sadle

My diamonds are lookin like I bought a ice glacier
Addicted to paper, I movin to Cali, I roll me a blunt and I go watch the Lakers

Pots in the pan, Quavo the baker, money in the jar, look like a saltshaker.

[Hook]@@@Adios|||[Verse 1: Quavo]

Daddy was a hospital patient, next thing you know he couldn't make it
I put my head down I ain't cry, cuz then I ain't know what death mean
Then a when a nigga growed up I ain't have my daddy on the scene

Use to eat dollar menu at mcdonalds, now I'm eating big plates at
Benihanas, gone.

Every move I make, is spectacular
Northside is my nation, and I'm an ambassador
I pray to the man above, palm to palm
Remember back in '07, almost lost my mom
That woulda hurt my heart, prolly wouldn't have no heart
Prolly would've been stopped right then, prolly wouldn't been no start
Back to kickin' them doors, back to juugin' them cars
But I pray to God, cause he healed my mom
If you talkin' 'bout that bread, then I want every crumb
Runnin' to the money like I'm in a marathon

Ice chain from Johnny Dang, diamonds kickin' like Liu Kang
Naked bitches in the kitchen sniffin' off of dishes
Got them Thanksgiving turkeys, Quavo sellin' whole chickens
Servin' patients like a clinic, runnin' bands up at Lenox
Quavo President Clinton, selling Monica Lewinsky

When them plays come my way, I might catch it like a mitten

Gold chains, bought my index a Versace ring
So much coke in my trap spot, the pot's hot
Money jumpin' out my shoe box like Jack Box
Bitches whippin' in the kitchen, bra and panties off
Never think 'bout juugin' cause they know I cut they fingers off
Catch me in Bahamas in Versace sandals
Takeoff got that A-1 dope whip game, Mrs. Campbells

Let's have a trap party, I'm bringin' iCarly
They think that I'm surfin', my dope is so gnarly
Lil' Daryll whip, my dope is retarded
The feds keep talkin', they say I'm a target
I'm slam dunkin' bricks they call me Amar'e
You know I got bucks but not from Milwaukee

Not city nigga, county nigga
Tell another nigga to do it like us, nigga
QC the label, money on the table

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Way back in the day nigga made No Label in a basement
Young nigga got all that talent
On the radio didn't have a placement
Linked up with the hood
OG Head Hancho, Migos
Then we took over the north
20 dollars to get your song played at Flamingos
Remember the days of hitting licks?
Every Christmas, had to be St. Nick
Payin' bills, tryna meet the rent
My mama she say that she sick of it
I had to go get to the Benjamin
Sorry Your Honor, I'm innocent
Money moves the commitment
No label, my life you witnessed it
From kickin' doors
Taking gold
What did I cash out on? I don't know
I will not tell on my soul
Cause Ion' know if the case closed
I know that you hate that Versace went gold
Now I'm walking round with a blue bankroll
Independent, never ever won't fold

[DJ Ray G]
See, I learnt the term from my nigga Biggie, right?
We went from ashy to classy
We went from having shit to fucking your bitch, my nigga
No Label, DJ Ray G
These my muthafucking brothers right here, Migo Gang
What niggas you know made a million in one summer without flipping bricks?
Ask your favorite rapper
I bet he say us, nigga
QC, the label
Hah! No Label!

[Verse 2: Offset]
Locked up on every mixtape
Quavo told me nigga wait
This is the only way we can escape
I realized it when I sat down for an 8
Grandma' told me and Quavo to be patient
Grandma' was a cancer patient
Before she died, she sat us down, said stay together and we're gonna make it
For you niggas don't know
Never really sold dope
But I kicked door
Free my nigga Willy, mane gave him to the dough
He didn't tell a soul
You making me sick to my stomach
I might go and vomit
You niggas is cloning
We not together cause you my opponent
Taking our style nigga we never loaned it
Labels wanna sign, that ain't on my mind
Critics and blogs, you know they ain't lying
Thirty thousand just to look at the time
Twenty five hundred for my Louboutin
Mansion Elan was our stomping ground
Our money big, your money minimized
Taking shots cause your buzz died
Cutting the top off the Lamb' make it circumcised
The world is fucked up but the strong survive

[DJ Ray G]
Haha, name your favourite club in Atlanta, my nigga
We ran that shit
We turned Mansion Elan
Into Migos Elan, nigga

My squad is so deep in the club, your fans and your people don't notice you
All of my niggas got diamonds, they flashin' they look like a photoshoot
I pull up in valet, the Audi got soft top but my top is bulletproof
And now they want jugg and finessin'
Now they want 'sace the necklace
At first we didn't expect it and now we expect it
At first the flow they neglect it and now they respect it

I know that this game is dirty Smith & Wesson

The trap concession stand, get you a slurpy
You obviously never been in a trap (never ever)
We shortage you, you ain’t get money back
Beating the pot Mortal Kombat, Jax
Brick big as hell, hit it with the axe
The gas is Ricky and you need some Act
The stove don't work just use a match
I’m fucking your bitch, she a nat nat
You don't Panamera, got a hatchback
Customer customer I am a hustler
I got candy Reese's Buttercup
Offset is worth 10 million plus
Touch down the plug, then drop a rope

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Contraband narcotic narcotic
Contraband contraband narcotic contraband
Contraband narcotic contraband contraband
Smoking OG's from Afghanistan
I got the candy, they call me the Candy-Man
Bands can’t fit in a rubber band
No football, I'm walking with thigh pads
Baking soda with the water
Stove on, throw the dope in a fire pan
Pick up the spatula, I’m the ambassador
Audi [?], like a tarantula
Making moves, spectacular
Beating the dope with the stick and it's magical
I set the block off and it's epical
For America, fucking register
Can’t fuck wit you niggas, too skeptical
Undercover, you work with the federals
OG, got bags and it's medical
Work in my bando
Got cookies they edible
Stretching the work it's incredible
Pull up on the plug so I can go pick up some

[Hook]@@@Add It Up|||[Intro: Quavo]
Ay, ay, count that money up, add it up!

Ay, go get the truckload, get the truckload, add it up!
Migos! Go!

The bricks just came in, the molly came in
The white just came in, you don't believe it, fuck nigga, add it up
Add it up [x9]

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Add it up like a new calculator
In the trap with two guns like I'm Tomb Raider
Hop on the track with no pen or paper
We blowin' up, I got that detonator
You could add up the dope like accountants
Put that dope in the water, don't drown it
Add it up right now, bet it motherfuckin' lookin'
Like a nigga livin' up on a mountain
I dreamed I woke up in Phantoms, naked bitches in a mansion
I did my calculations, most of you rappers is imitatin'
They back on the island, I'm contemplatin'
Should I shoot to kill in my situation?
Mama said "Quavo, better stay patient!"
The dirt that I done you add up the cases

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Offset]
Beep! Fff!
That's that money machine and it's addin' up!
The trap is a bakery, whippin' and cookin'
The dope, I send it straight to Canada!
Young Offset trappin' in your area
Jungle fever, got the white and I marry her
I see Justin Beaver, the ghost is way scarier
Hit a juug, fifty bags of the good cannabis
All these other conversations irrelevant
If you ain't talkin' bout Benjamin Frank
Gold fingers like a trophy and painting
Got the 45., turn you to a sharp painting
My pockets is healthy, Zanotti Giuseppe
My money is stretching, my money athletic
Tyler Perry, makin' movies, they epic
I'm not the one from Cuba, that's my necklace

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
We fucked the world up when we dropped that "Versace"
It topped the chart, nigga, so add it up
"Versace", it got us a M and 'em
Don't believe me, fuck nigga, then count it up
Stealing my flow, we come to your show
Put you on camera and we embarrass ya
Fuck your management, and your manager
You is a amateur, choppa'll damage ya
Trappin' and cappin', had to make it happen
Trapper turned rapper, my mama happy
On the block trappin', don't serve undercovers
Snakes in that grass, they gon' get you on trouble
If I get jammed, put that on my mama
That I won't tell on my brother
In the bando and I'm countin' the fuck out the p's
Got rich off a pot and some water

[Hook]@@@Peek A Boo|||[Hook: Quavo]

Try me leave you a memorial
Off in the river they finding you snorkeling
My bitches addicted to Michael Kors
Very "sadiddy" items just like Tom Ford
I got the white like a chalkboard
Break in the trap you gon' pay for it
20 pairs of Christian Louboutins
Pick a shoe, pick a shoe, pick a shoe
They asking bout what it is to beef with you rappers
Sorry I don't want an interview
Thundershock the pot like Pikachu
Where is my revenue?
They investigating like the Blue's Clues
Momma said try different avenues
Most of my people they didn't believe until I turned into a Hercules
Ever since day one we took off
I talked to God, he said 'Murda please!'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Offset]
Double R Ghost nigga peekaboo
Broke as a bitch nigga, pitiful
Locked up doing time, Lambo no mind
Jesus pieces, nigga spiritual
I just woke up in a mansion
Wondering how the fuck did this shit happen
The blogs, they say I be snapping
Making a movie, lights, camera, action
I'm beating the pot, knuckles gotta fraction
We invented the flow niggas got it packed
When we walk in the club we the main attraction
Too much smoke in the room, breathing like Toni Braxton
These bitches they loving our personality
You niggas so sweet I might catch a cavity
I'm the king of this shit nigga I'm your majesty
Drinking lean and my bitch drinking Daiquiri

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Just left the jeweler
I bought a Yacht-Master, the master yacht
I just bought a Bentley Mulsanne
They callin' me samurai the way I chop the top
Steve Nash, I pass the rock
Shaquille O'Neal how I block a shot
Three Amigos I might chill at the sharks
Booting your bitch up with molly rocks
That Rolex ain't real if it tic-toc
They asking me when is the mixtape gon' drop
Peekaboo all of my diamonds shining
Glisten my diamonds in China
My necklace dripping down my spinal
I'm richer than Richie no Lionel
Lil' kids they call me their idol
Cause I inspire and you expire

What-you-want: Mi-go!

Pull up with that choppa and a telescope
Got 50 chickens in with me, runnin' amount in my city
Young rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys, rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys
We makin' a motion picture, Michelangelo

Antidope, antidope, antidope, antidope

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Yo, Quavo
I got the antidope try to come juuggin' and I'm bustin' your cantaloupe
I'm trappin' out of the bando, still got tools like Rambo
I'm feelin' like Larry Houdini
The pack was just here did you see it
The plug he be here any second now
If he didn't then something went down
We losing a bags, gotta go to the stash
At the age of 19, I was running from the task
Put it on my mama, no flex, no brag
Young nigga been had cash
Jus me and Rel Money got rich off a half a bag
That's why they mad

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I got the antidope
I'm feelin' like Scarface, Al Pacino comin' off a banana boat
And how the fuck 200 Migo touchin' down in Mexico
Fuckin' around with Eduardo, told me that he know Armando
Armando fuckin' with Carlos, Carlos wrappin' em up in the barcodes
Ridin' around with that Scotty and brand new Bugattis
OG Miley Cyrus, snakes tryna give me the virus
But I got that antidope like I know science but I'm no scientist
Fuckin' around with them bombs but I am no terrorist
Piss on your bitch that R Kelly shit
I'm on Mount Everest sippin' on medicine

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Offset]
Austin Powers you niggas be takin' my Mojo
Young nigga I got the antidope
Coke and baking soda minerals

Young nigga I never make honor roll

Whippin' and cookin' and flippin' chickens
You say you got money but pussy nigga you don't have a witness
Cause I've never seen it
I'm a rich nigga I mean it
Keep talkin' bullets go through yo' beanie
I'm in a phantom ghost call that shit Casper
Young nigga plugged in like adapters
Stomp yo' ass out like a alpha
Ahead of you niggas you still in the first chapter

[Hook]@@@Migo Dreams|||[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Slide in the pussy like a surfboard
Killing these niggas get a hearse for 'em
Fuck you niggas even sellin work for
You next to tell put your chirp on
Be the main reason pussy niggas gettin' murked for
Young nigga who you work for
Cause I came from the bosses I ain't for no losses you play in this dirt for 'em
And I came from the first floor
Gangbanging hoes like a turf war
Then hit the road for my first tour
My level went up to the third floor
And I swerved on these hating niggas
MIA, with some Haitian niggas
Bad bitches keep takin' pictures
I pulled up in that ransom nigga like whoa

[Hook: Quavo]
Let me talk Meek Mills
I bet you didn't know my niggas make millions
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine under water, you don't know how I'm feeling right now

[Verse 2: Quavo]
All of my life I ain't wanted nothing but Franklin
Touchdown on a fuck nigga make him tuck in his shell like he Franklin
You and my niggas are not the same
I jumped out the Lamb like Bruce Wayne
The ten piece of chicken is on the way
I told 'em Carlito to andale
You see them new niggas in the back of the club
Just look at them plottin' in conversations
I know they don't know
Send the Migos to come back to the bando for translation
Camera rollin' Quavo's Spike Lee
Heroin black like Willie B
If you do the coke you gon' buy some skis
If you in the trap you gon' buy some ki's

[Hook: Quavo]
I bet you didn't know my niggas make millions
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine under water, you don't know how I'm feeling right now

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Young Takeoff I am a professional
Vegetarian I only eat vegetables
I got some kush you can roll up
And I got some kush you can eat that is edible
Stretching the work like I'm Mr. Incredible
You ain't never seen no work as flexible
When I turn on the stove & I'm whippin' a brick better pray my niggas turn to predators

[Verse 4: Offset]
I bet you didn't know I was 22 when the judge ten times what a miracle
Me and my son identical
Seventeen years old I had him I didn't know what to do
I had to put food on the plate
Asking the Lord give a nigga some faith
Now when I wake up I look at my label
My foot on the pedal not touching the brake
No chess but nigga I got me a check!

[Hook: Quavo]
I bet you didn't know my niggas make millions
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine water, you don't know how I'm feeling right now@@@Kidding Me|||[Intro: Takeoff & Quavo]
Fuck!

They say the nigga that robbed you is in the trap right now
I said I pull up, and start damping at the whole crowd
Nigga better stop playing with me

You know that they taking your style?

Who the hell said we a one hit wonder?
Migo pockets sloppy like lasagna, nigga stop playing with me

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Who the fuck said QC we ain't on top? Gotta be kidding me
Who the fuck said YRN2 gon' flop? Must be kidding me
The niggas that didn't believe in me
The people that didn't believe in me
Versace, Versace it topped the charts
Now I'm on BET and MTV
Remember back then watching Oprah?
Now I'm on the sofa with Oprah
Louboutins all on her sofa
No strings attached cause these loafers
OG gas pack got the odor
Green like Shrek that's an ogre
Taking my swag and exposure
Pull up to your house and foreclose ya'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Thought I fucking told you fuck nigga better stop playing with me
Hop out with the dirty stick, the drum, holds infinity
My bitch run down with 50 chickens in an SRT
I ain't make it out of high school, it ain't no shame in me
I'm richer than my teachers, damn I know I bet they mad at me
With yo' red light on, in the bando get it like Krispy Kremes
Hit the pot with the left hook, Quavo-Kareem
You ain't never seen a mountain of snow on that triple beam

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Offset]
All of you niggas you mimic me, you kidding me? Literally
Controlling the block with good quality
Hurricane in the kitchen, a catastrophe
I'm number one you are the niggas after me
Wrapping my bitch up in diamonds from Tiffany's
Everyday a holiday, epiphany
All you pussy niggas talking and bickering
Ya'll don't even make no goddamn sense
Cuffing the same bitch I fucked that's my bitch
Whoosh, pack gone missing
Soon as you touch on my hand it's disappearing instantly
Diamonds on me looking like it's a photo
Guiseppe's and now they walking on komodo
Feelin' like Austin they stealing my mojo
Trapping and capping we selling that yayo

Finessing a country ass nigga in Newnan
I'm sitting the down as you niggas are viewing

Top floor condo got to use the elevator
Trappers be biting just like it's a gator
Leaving them holes in a nigga like vega

Thanking the Lord for my Ends in my Prayers
I'm a young black nigga with all white neighbors
I stay in a Mansion with Forty Acres

It could be that four-hour flight, shopping in Beverly

What's on your mind?
I'm not Ginuwine
Ain't tryna spend no time

80 thousand old hundreds, Jerry Rice

I didn't get a diploma, I'm rich for life
They didn't believe me
BET, MTV, made you see it

Lil' mamma she wasn't fucking with me

The plug he wasn't fucking with me
Until I got all them Benjis

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Offset]
No you are not fucking with me
When I ain't had no currency (where were you?)
You know you left a nigga hanging
Treated me like I'm a stranger

The plug wasn't even fronting me a key (fuck the plug)
But it's no pressure
Im'a take the little nick and I'll flip it
Im'a flex on you like a wrestler

Even since a nigga stopped fucking with you baby girl, my life been better
And I'm successful
I can flex in my bezzles
I did this on my own, with no help from nobody

She licked me, she fucked me, she sucked me
Then tried to give me a kid, but she's tripping, (Huh?)

Told that bitch, "Pour your own muddy trouble"
I shouldn't have fucked her, now she's in her feelings, (What?)
Shawty broke down and start telling her business
I said to lil' mama, "You tripping
I don't give a fuck what you did, cause business is business." (Business is business!)

So now we sitting in my condo, (Top floor!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]

Everybody get it even civilians
The only people that I spare is the children
I'm sending you niggas to take away your body parts
Karate chop that nigga like it's martial-arts
Shot that nigga left 'em at the park
Put the pussy nigga on a milk carton
My choppa banana-clipped, it got a knife
Don't roll the dice nigga you risk your life

[Verse 4: Machine Gun Kelly]
Ugh, fuck a bitch cause it's Thug Life
Smoking good cause my plug right

Bought my first Audi with the fish scale guts

When I Come to the bando, knock two times then twist the handle
Got everything in stock, whatever you need, just ask me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
When I was a kid all I wanted was a hundred dollar bill
Now I’m 19, young nigga want 100 mil

Want an ounce? Can't bust the seal
Wanna be a trapper? Never serve a nigga where you live
In the Bando counting chips no poker
Weighing bales of Okra
I got lots of O's, put my name right next to Al Capone
I'm a Wizard, Antwan Jamison
My plug ain't Kangaroo Jack, but he Australian
And he got crack sacks in the knapsack
Critics say I'm a product of my environment
Selling that dope to economists
Menace to society
On the top of the mountain, you under me
Young nigga, I’m trapping and grinding
No scale for the workers, I'm eying it
You niggas still nickel and diming
Remix the dope and you niggas still buying it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Offset]
Fuck the rap game cause these rap niggas really ain't shit

Fuck it I’m smashing that bitch
Young rich nigga with the Rollie wrist

You fuck niggas really ain't serving
Selling the bricks to the plug up in Berlin
Put the dope in the water, hit it with the egg beater
Sipping lean, yeah I'm good, I'm tequila
My neck is so sick, got the measles
This for my my niggas that trap in the Regal
Ounces, ounces, ounces, molly Santana's tall as a mountain
Put the molly on top of her tonsils
She sucking and fucking, she ain’t got no manners
Back to the basics, I’m counting these faces
My pockets inflating off trapping and baiting
You niggas fugazy
My niggas, they strapped like the Navy
I’m the mayor
Matter fact I’m the president
Sipping on Actavis, like it's my medicine
Throwing the bird with accuracy
All of you niggas is amateur
Pull up in Phantoms, but trap out of Challengers

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Run with the sack like I'm Emmitt and I keep the aiming for niggas who envy

We not acceptin' apologies, sellin' the dope to economist
Young rich nigga ridin' 'round in the Bentley
Throwin' money on the ceiling momma told me I'm ignant!

Hit a nigga with the antedote and we burry him
Hop in the Jag', I'm droppin' the top back
Smoking on gas like a nigga got cataracts

"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee"
That's the late great words of Mohammed Ali
Got to move real smooth, if the feds watch me
Got to hit them real hard if a nigga try me
"Boom! Boom! Boom!"
Can we fix it, like Bob the Builder?
Break in my trap and I kill ya (Pswiw!)
These nigga ain't built like my nigga

You niggas can't built like that with no courage
You niggas out here were left hurting
Locking the block down like Richard Sherman

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me

Pussy nigga thought a nigga was rookie, hit me for the cookies

Where were you...

[Hook: Quavo]
Where were you when I was whipping it in the kitchen
Where were you when I was jugg finessing midget
Where were you when I was facing time off tickets
They wanna come around
Where were you...
Where were you when I was down and out and I was in the drought
Where were you when mama said she gon' kick me out
Where were you when I was down on my knees ain't had nun
Now I am at the top right now, just look at you

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I swear, I swear I'm gon' make it to the top this year
Where where, where where, when I whip it, when I flip it lil mama you trippin'

Now you going through what I've been going through, bitch you struggling
I know that you hate it, I know that you mad you're getting a dose of your medicine
The day of reckoning, move out of town I recommend
I treated you with proper etiquette
Where were you when I was being in the pen?
The Hannah Montana the molly's anthem
Plug in China I ain't have to meet this man
Choppers imported from Kazakhstan
Where were you when the eggbeater was in my hand?

[Hook: Quavo]

[Verse 2: TakeOff]
I'm at the top right now, hate to see you at the bottom
But you wasn't fucking with me when I was taking that gwalla

You sellout rapper at the bottom [?]
The models they watching the niggas they follow
Double G all on my collar
Bitch say she wants red bottoms
Paying tuition for college
Baby just look at me honest
You wasn't fucking with me when I was at Onyx
For money, back then I was boring, hell no
When I hop in my Porsche of course I know
Big ass bank rolls won't fold
Where were you when I was trapping out the bando
Now the nigga on the radio
Touring doing shows, on the road
Travel all over the globe
But where were you when I was broke

[Hook: Quavo]

[Verse 3: Offset]
As I remember
You quitted on me you surrendered
You pretender, acting like you was there when I was up in the blender
I'm the number one contender, don't hold grudges because I am a forgiver
You niggas make me have a bad temper, [?] said that offended her
I'm still trying to figure out
Where the fuck you was at when a nigga couldn't get out
I'm rich as a bitch with a smart mouth
Like Martin do Pam, bitch get out
Excuse a nigga if I'm acting rude
You was not there when I had no food
You want to start over I'm not a fool
These bitches not loyal she broke the rules
Trifling bitch I'm not wifing it
Left a nigga when I got indicted
You fucked my partner tryna keep it silent
My diamonds shining like the police sirens
My plug on the boat like a pirate
Pussy niggas they don't like me
Real niggas fuckin' with me
Baby girl you wasn't with me

Asking me questions like "How did I feel when I had to sit down for a 8?"
They bitin' the swag but we killing these rappers
You wanna rob Migo first place (Number 1!)
Put ‘em in a grave, disintegrate (Glaw!)
Blue Benjamins all on my dinner plate
Is Offset ever gonna get on a chorus? (Is he? Huh?)
Just wait on it! (Wait on it!)
I’m your favorite rapper’ favorite
Every rapper bite in, they want a taste of it
There is no secret who really created it
I’m on D block, I feel like I’m Jadakiss
Migos blew up like a terrorist
We murdering tracks and it’s evident

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Quavo]
They want me to sign to your label
Told them to wait and they looked at me crazy
Three M&M's ain’t shit
No way that we signed, we ripped out the paper
We know that you stealing the fucking flow
It's okay because I got the antidote
We pulling the string like a jump rope
We got the rap game in submission, ho
Came up from a pound of midget now I’m riding around in the 750
Pull up to that bando, just me and extensions
Them pans them pot like business is business
Feeling like summer, Infinity
BOW! GLAW! No witnesses
My niggas been playas like Birdman and Trinidad
None of you rappers can fuck with me, bet on me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
So you wanna be in this rap game? (You wanabe?)
First you gotta make a name (TakeOff!)
QC the label they hate on it
The rich niggas too, they gonna wait on it
It’s a new generation, OGs like Temptations
Solid Foundation my Margiela looks Mason
My money Caucasian, my dope is Caucasian
My plug is a Haitian so how am I racist?
Like Nike I’m ‘bout to start checking you niggas
You Kermit the Frog, I’m dissecting you niggas
You sickle cell nigga, I’m sick of you niggas
You taking my swag, I invented you niggas
Call me Einstein, I got the potion
So I know how to get rid of you niggas
DeNada sneakers, Giuseppe sweater
Stop and say I can do this acapella

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Just now warming up, might pull up in an armored truck
With a hundred blue million bucks
I told you brah, that we so dangerous, yo niggas ain't the same as us
I gotta thank God for the blessing
Pocket salad, extra dressing
He always got a nigga flexing

If you wanted to ball
You gotta run with it and score a touchdown
If you wanna be a rap artist
Gotta take over your town (the city!)
If you wanna be a dope dealer
Gotta be moving a pound (Ew! Gas!)
Young nigga just stay focused
(If you did it) You can be rich right now

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Offset]
I'm richer than Richie, now all my bitches they miss me
I was broke I remember
I stashed it away in my memory
I know niggas that envy me, jealousy
Wondering how did I get rich with these felonies
God keep on telling me;
'Please just focus! '
I came from roaches to Lotus
They hung my brother like posters
The Lord he told me I'm chosen
Now all my jewelry is golden
Sipping on purple potion, take away all the emotions (Lean!)
Christian Louboutins, I'm not running from my emotions

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Unfortunate, ya'll fuck niggas can't fuck with us
Hundred gas bags in the monster truck
Usain Bolt, I'm a run it up
Real street nigga that love to hustle, came from the gutta
My nigga be flexing, pressing
I'm fucking that bitch that you texting
You stressin? (Haha)
We just sitting in here counting cash, trying not to laugh
All of these presidents, OG gas
Sipping on Actavis out the glass
Hundreds older than the ThunderCats
What would you do, if you found out that your face card wasn't approved
Ain't no money getting extorted
Look at that what these streets will do

Yo, nice to meet you

No Gilligan, I'm on the islands
Splash, trip, islands
Water, islands
Splash, trip, lots of islands
Living on the islands

[Verse 1 - Quavo:]
Quavo, Quavo, on the islands cooling like Gullah Gullah
I'm independent I ain't tryna sign to Warner Brothers
We'll take ten mil' for a Label deal
And I don't want the PT if it ain't Double Seal
Life is a gamble game, wrist still a hurricane
In a Audi getting brain, swerving in the other lane
They wanna fuck with me cause I'm a millionaire
Spectacular, the choppas in the back and in the frigidaire
You don't even wanna bust a move, come on my friend
Got them on stand-by on snooze, stand-by my free
I just pushed the button and you lose, you lose my free
PAW!

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Ty Dolla $ign:]
I got dreads like I'm from the islands
Smokin' weed like I'm from the islands
I just met a bad lightskin bitch on Highland

Dolla Sign and Migos we the trendsetters
Pushaz Ink the label we the trendsetters
That's yo' bitch, on God, she was just with us
That's yo' bitch, tonight, nigga don't kiss her
Rum and coke, she drink pina coladas
I only smoke kush, these niggas still on the chronic
Met a redbone, in bikini bottoms
Look just like Rihanna, say she from the islands

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Rich The Kid:]
My bitch from the islands I covered her in diamonds
The haters can't stop me from shinin'
Don't play with me nigga, Machete will hit you
Young nigga you know that I'm Haitian
I had to stay down while we trappin' the vacant
Mama she said we would make it
Feels good to be rich
Got a jet, take a trip
Fuck nigga we made it!
The plug on the islands, no Gilligan
I pull out my wallet, finessin' him
I be with the migos, no Mexican
I'm a young rich nigga
I'm buying whatever no matter the cost
Yo' boyfriend about to come fuck with a boss
I ride in a Maybach, no Ross

[Verse 4 - Offset:]
Welcome to my island
Lions, bears, and tigers
Selling babies, cooking toddlers
Bad bitches givin' knowledge
Welcome to my land
Molly santan' kickstand
Choppas on deck like Iran
Whippin' and flippin' them candy yams
On the islands, no Gilligan
You niggas are sweeter than Cinnamon
I run to the money with energy
My loafers are 'gator amphibians
Rocca been trappin' for centuries
How the hell you don't know Benjamin?
You run up on me it's a penalty
His pack went missin', a mystery

[Hook]@@@3 Mics|||[Hook:]
I came from mug shots
To posters on the block
Keep our song on replay
Now all we need is 3 Mics and a DJ
3 Mics and a DJ x3

Know 3 young niggas on the North
By name of Quavo, Offset and Takeoff
We mobbing pull up at your house
Squad open the trunk and I pull out that sawed off
Cutomuto he gone cut your throat, Migos dressed in the cut knock your jaw off
I came from bitches staring at me
Now when they see me they taking their top off
Brazilians, Snow Bunnies, and I like Dominicans
Gold on my Giuseppe Steppers, red on the bottom on my Christian Louboutins
I used to be jugging, finessing, remixing the plug on the island like Gillegan
I gave em a flow, and they stealing it
The block on fire, I can extinguish it

[Hook]

3 mics 3 mics 3 mics nigga that changed my life
Mama she told me get right
No more standing over the stove at night
Now I rock the stage and I get paid, it's 50k in my resume
Remember hitting licks in the Honda
Now I'm riding round president tints on a escalate
Picking hard ball like the Braves
Rocking out shows on the gravey
I told my mama we made it, Harriet Tubman chains no slavery
Breaking the sweat like the 80's
Play with the water like Navy
My niggas really in the field
3 mics we don't need a fucking deal

[Hook]

Back in the day a flamingo DJ Ray G playing Bando

Offset never listen had to do a sentence when i got out we took to the top

[Hook]@@@Freestyle|||[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Pull up and wet up the city don't care about no feelings
I shoot at your children
Pull up and kill 'em don't care bout no feelings
I pop out and shoot at the city
I'm cooking big birds and chickens
I pull up with tons and tons of da midgets
I'm going far as the stars you're afraid of heights the sky is my limit
You're bittersweet like a lemon
Hey I'm a move you up to Beverly but not the Center
Hey Young Thug gon' bite that fish just like it's tenders
The way I'm geek'd up don't noun one of my members
Hannah Montana, banging in red bandana
10 thousand dollars toe ring right inside of my sandals
My bitch having swellas, she ride with the nana
She don't give no fuck 'bout no cameras (Bling bitch!)
She got her a lawyer not goin' to the slammer
Plus she did trial in a Phantom (Rich bitch!)
I'm a pull up leave it running, I walk in the club, don't play I snook the gun in
My bitch think she dreaming cause I grabbed the Tommy
She thought that I grabbed on my stomach (tummy!)
Cook so much dope it startin to look just like comic
It could make a young kid vomit
Catch a dumb ho, hook her up to phonics
I'm slick and ironic

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I'm taking your bitch out to Beverly Hills
And I did'nt give her nothing but a molly pill
I'm the Fresh Prince and I live on a mansion, young nigga my daddy not Phil
Me and Young Thugga we drank muddy trouble
My pockets inflating like I blew a bubble
When the mixtape dropping Migo?
Young nigga just wait on it! You acting like undercover (12!)
In the kitchen and I'm whipping the pot
And it getting thick on me like peanut butter
Baw, glaw
Short with the gwalla, I'm coming at you like the headhunter

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Pull up on you and your people
Me and my Migos illegal but that choppa legal

[Verse 4: Offset]
Pull up and I got the Tommy aim it at yo' head I turn it to an omelette

You an informant I hang you like ornaments
Pics in my mansion Mozart did the portraits
Got your bitch in the condo I'm all in her ovary
'Sace my chest out like I am with Jodeci
I'm a wizard with bricks, Harry Potter, do sorcery
I'm at the top and no nigga is over me
Run in yo' house like I'm Jeeper Creeper pour a 4 in the 2 liter
Christian tha Louboutin, walking on hyena
Straight out the trenches I use a egg-beater I whip up a beamer
Beat it like Tina...
Beat it like Jax and I beat the pot my knuckle got a damn fracture (ha ha!)
Add up the digits my nigga money on top of money, fractions
My niggas they all about action, no camera
Pull out the choppa, it hit yo' ass hard like the judge, with the hammer
You niggas is monkey
That's why the choppa got a Hundred-round hanging, banana
These bitches be asking me questions like
'Offset why the hell you walking on mammals?'

White Lambo Jennifer Aniston
Black diamonds, I call it African
Offset fresher than a mannequin
YRN plugged in with Rich Gang
We got plenty money, diamond chains

[Verse 5: Young Thug]

Throw away the cutlass get a Panamera
Hey, Mama gotta mansion now she perfect
Spared my last mill but it turned out to be worth it

Let's have a trap party, I'm bringin' iCarly
They think that I'm surfin', my dope is so gnarly
Lil' Daryll whip, my dope is retarded
The feds keep talkin', they say I'm a target
I'm slam dunkin' bricks they call me Amar'e
You know I got bucks but not from Milwaukee
It's never a drought, it's bricks on the market

[Hook]@@@Cross The Country|||[Takeoff:]
Young rich nigga, riding round the city with the mac
Take a chopper, and a chicken, now what's the ticket
Whipping and breaking it, making it, taking it
Nigga they mistake me, think I'm selling that midget
Nah for real
What the fuck a nigga really wanna talk about?
You a bitch, we ain't got nothing to talk about
Shaking like a stripper, put that magic up in his mouth
Skippa Da Flippa, he told me weigh it up, and bust it down
Migo Jerz, whipping that lambo, now watch it swerve
J-1 got PT's, and sold that reserved
I'm a (Hot) Boy, so you know I gotta stay low
Quavo told me, trap on the block and bang 'em like OJ Mayo
You niggas are rookie but young Takeoff, I'm a vet
Set! Told me trapping and dabbing gon' get that pussy wet
No Crocodile Dundee, Stingray vet
Whatever I wanna do, I do it, Nike check
I'm a young nigga, with the rich nigga ambitions
At the Migo show, a nigga autographing titties
There's levels to this shit like Meek said
And you embarrassed to admit it
I don't want to kick it
After my show
The gangster-ist nigga, he looking suspicious
Walk right up on him, I'm pressing my nigga
And all he wanted was a picture
I used to smoke swishers, like a regular nigga
Now I'm a backwoods type of nigga
A nigga, he run up, tried to rob, I shot him
White people, they still treat me like I'm a victim
Now people they screaming out "Free Activis"
They talking bout that Activis be discontinued
Kept my cup of muddy trouble, trapper, got packs in the attic
Kept me 'round, with pricing my rental
Trap, trap down when I'm on the revenue
Cooking a brick, and remix it with the dog food
Diamond brick with a note on it, nigga you Blues Clues
24 karat my time, Mr. T, pity a fool
Master P, no limit, money been all jumping like a bungee
Kevin Hart, your money is too short, you too funny
Call me Takeoff Hugh Hefner, I got playboy bunnies
Fuck it, I beat it, she sucking me till a nigga be cumming

[Hook:]
Cross the country
Cross the country
You ain't never been there to catch me
Cross the country

Cross the country
Cross the country
Coca leaves, and palm trees
We cross the country

Cross the country
Cross the country
She don't understand English, but she want me

Cross the country
Cross the country
I had to get a visa, cause I'm in and out the country

[Offset:]
When you in the streets, you know you gotta make a name
I stole a mustang, drop top, no brain
Police had a nigga, cause they know I'm in the game
Taking pictures of a nigga, like a groupie, like a fan
On my first lick, only got a little bit of change
Thinking like Obama, something gotta change
Did a lot of dirt, I had to sit up in the chains
When I got outta jail, did the same thing
I spent that money, money, coming back like boomerang
Cocaine in her nose like a Sodom rain
My nigga be trapping the gas, propane
Hit the nigga with a chopper, nigga bang bang
I was getting money, way before the rap game
As a young nigga, used to wear the fake chain
They say that I'm ignorant, $50, 000 on a chain
You know it ain't come from Johnny Dame
Fake watch, busta can't bust me, no lie
Walk at me with the fake jewelry, I got too much pride
They killed my nigga Pistol Pete, for a three-five
I pay the ticket, when are you gon' die
I'm in the kitchen, I be cooking crack pies
I got chickens in the trunk, you think I work at popeyes
The streets is a jungle, my nigga, you better survive
Getting married to the money nigga, that my bride
My diamonds gon' shine, might poke you in the eye
You selling by the ounce, my nigga, you just getting by
Put the birds in my hands, knows when's it gon' fly
Clack! Clack! Clack!
In the bushes like a spy
Nigga talking stupid, we don't let that shit fly
Talking crazy to the migos, boy you know we keep the fire
Got that chopper, flip a nigga like a domino
Young rich nigga, never made the honor roll
Hit his ass with the 4 4, make him fold
Chattahoochee river where that nigga body float
On the nation, my nigga we throwing up the Folks
She on a mission, trying to film me, better get your ho
Big bank, take little bank
Yellow diamonds on my rella like a moon cake
Two Glocks on my hip, like tomb raider
Arnold Schwarzenegger, turn into the terminator

[Hook]

[Quavo:]
Cross the country
My plug he in Wyoming
And the only time I pull up on you, if a nigga owe me
And the whole word know that a young nigga rap
But a pussy nigga better not provoke me
Came in the game with the formula, sold it
Now I gotta switch it up on you phonies
Pocket full of macaroni, mac-11, run up on you
All you can eat in my trap, like it's Shoney's
Rich Nigga Timeline
That's my motherfucking testimony
Out in the desert, got bricks in the donkey
Rich nigga, with a pot of gold, like a leprechaun
And I'm thinking 'bout moving to Babylon
My niggas collecting extortion funds
We built an empire like Megatron
QC the label
Migo the gang
Already told you
I want the M&Ms, fuck the fame
No shame in game, I'm a bull with the nine
Like Loul Deng, finna bang with the thing
Walking through the crowd, ain't gotta touch the chain
Get juuged, get capped, that's a part of the game
Squad shit
Oh no
I done rolled around the block and I don't see him
I paid a J $200, just to hit me when he see him
If I was you right now, I wouldn't wanna be him
Caught him two weeks later in the club, with his mamacita
He had some jewelry on him, worth $100, so I took it from him
Took the first PJ across the country, got too hot for a moment
They say he got work, now I own him
Now my squad, they going nuts, no Makonnen
In the players pad, at the Caesar's Palace
Out in Las Vegas, like I'm Roman
All types of euros and yen
I got money in Berlin
I told the Lord forgive me for my sins
Cause I don't wanna do it again

[Hook]@@@Rich Nigga Timeline|||[Hook - Quavo:]
First kicked the door when I was 17 years old
Seen my first 50, ballin', 18 years old
Let that pistol go when I was 19 years old
First time turned 20, I was cashin' out on gold
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, ye ain't live your life like mine
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, stay the fuck up out of mine

[Verse 1 - Quavo:]
Free my nigga Westside, locked up to this day
R.I.P. my migo P, my nigga dead in the grave
And I dare a fuck nigga come and try me today
Abracadabra his face
Quavo the magician, the pack gone it's missin'
I got a ho and she got a ho and now they both kissin'
Do you remember, the life I was livin'?
I'm callin' the plug, I'm juugin' up pounds, I'm breakin' down midget
I got the birds, pigeons
They know who the fuck run the city (Nawfside!)
I might pull up with that chopper and extensions
I just let it off, I empty about 50
Mama said, "Quavo don't spend all your Benjis"
Told mama, "I'm sorry, pockets on infinity"
You can ask around, really hit them juugs for the fuckin' pound
Next time you see me, better not ask me for no money now
Never went to school, never thought about Clark or Morris Brown
'Til I took your bitch, drop her off right there by Morris Brown
Used to cook up bricks 'til I turned that shit to an extra now
I got the magic stick, feelin' like Criss Angel, bitch
I disappear bricks

[Hook - Quavo]

[Verse 2 - Offset:]
17 stackin' and countin', 18 I ran from the bounty
You niggas is softer than Bounty, my nigga got 15, free Ronny
Check out my bio, plenty felonies, known for countin' up broccoli
Known for stackin' up celery, you niggas ain't even a vet to me
'Member the days? Run in your house like a raid
Young nigga tryna get paid
Pistol to his face, give him a shave
Never selfish, all the money I gave
Never change, all the money I make
1 baby, all these bitches I laid
2 guns, nigga, never afraid
Migos the army I'm never gon' trade
Set-Set hit a 20 band juug
He helped the hood, everybody was good
I'm white like a tiger and I got the wood
My niggas on go like Nike, they gon' do it
These niggas wonderin', like how did we do it?
Water diamonds on my neck look like fluid
I'm from the Zone 3 if you niggas ain't knew it
I'm throwin' up the north cause that is my hood
Locked up, mama couldn't get me out
Called my nigga Bookie, he got me out
KK got my back, ain't no doubt
Player made, free my bro, let him out
This shit is crazy, shout out mama house
Don't come to my trap and you unannounced
21 Challenger mounted up
Doin' phones, fucked your credit up
When you a boss they gon' cherish yah
Investigations, I didn't tell 'em nothin'
December 25th, on the run
I didn't know if I was comin' home
19, I was on my own
My grandma died, cancer on her bones
I ran in houses just to buy some Foams
You can hear the pain in my voice on my songs

[Hook - Quavo]

[Verse 3 - Takeoff:]
13 I got my first halftime
14, broke in the club for an Alpine
15 I got my first Glock 9
It was rusty but it still'd bust a nigga
I was lil' nephew, they wasn't gon' touch a nigga
If I did, my uncles'll bust a nigga
Migo gang, they couldn't fuck with a nigga
Started beefin' with some sucka niggas
Belushi's right there up on Club Drive
It's was y'all side versus Nawfside
Knocked a couple niggas out a couple times
Got in shootouts with niggas a hundred times
Come to your party, we fuckin' it up
Young niggas, we never gave a fuck
Young niggas, 10, 12, 13, on go with a finger point
A lot of squads start poppin' up
Screamin' shit that we ain't heard of
Migos pull up at your residence
Here comes the issue, "it wasn't us, bruh"
We know you flexin', got the information
So you still gon' get hit with the uppercut
Beat a nigga to a puddle, nigga snitchin'
Now we runnin' from the task force
Niggas was kickin' in doors, takin' flat screens and all the gold
Never got it and I sat on it, nigga, everything I got was sold
Apple Mac, juugin' laptops
Knock in your door, take your lil' brother's Xbox
Migo Jerz stand around the curb
Used to match up in the hotbox
Hit a juug for some True Religions
And some Robin Denims in a public community
My brother's keepers, Migo we got unity
[?] at the park right on Harrington
To the bando, you see niggas gamblin'
Hit a kick door my niggas be ramblin'
I got a bag on my back like I'm Santa Claus
Finnesse a nigga at Papa John's up in Panama

[Hook - Quavo]@@@Can't Believe It|||[Intro - Offset:]
I came out of jail to about 300 thousand. Gadgets on my whip, I'm lookin' at this mothafucka like how the fuck am I supposed to start this shit, man? (Yeah) Rich Nigga Timeline. (I know you can't believe this shit.) Unbelievable. (We did it.) Nah, forreal

[Hook - Quavo:]
Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, can't believe it, can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
Can't believe that my nigga Pistol missing
I can't believe we survived the sentence
Say you can't believe it, but I know you seen it
I can't believe that you don't want to witness
Can't believe it, can't believe it, can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it

[Verse 1 - Quavo:]
You say you didn't see but you can't believe it
When it come to kickin' doors I make you believe
We took off the block, cold, anemic
Touch down on the north and I really feed it
Mama, she told me go get it, get it
How can I not believe that she with it?
She came in my room, caught me breakin' a safe
Then she asked me, "Boy, Quavo what's really in it?"
Down in Miami, the 305
They tried to assassinate us like Biggie
What the hell goin' on?
No time to talk, bustin' back with extensions
Who got the iron?
I'm prayin' the Lord the bullet don't hit one of us in the spine
Open your eyes, stand up and bust with the fire
Stand up and bust with the fire

[Hook - Quavo]

[Verse 2 - Takeoff:]
I can't believe it, how I got these bitches
They suckin' me like they some leeches
These niggas, they actin' like bitches, they wanna take pictures
They not a rapper on a feature
Wake up in the mornin', I say me a prayer like a preacher
I teach myself like a nigga had a teacher
I got Justin Bieber in my cabin fever
Picasso pretty pictures is Mona Lisa
I can take a trip to Argentina in amnesia
I don't need a fuckin' visa
I can't believe that we did what we did
But I pray to the man above, nigga we did it
Watch over my brother, I'm my brother's keeper
Dressed in black Margiela, I'm the Grim Reaper
Can you believe that we made a milli off of "Versace" money
Mentions ran off the meter

[Hook - Quavo]

[Verse 3 - Offset:]
Achievers, you niggas just disbelievers
Used to be in the bando with egg beaters
You seen the first chapter, now this the sequel
I'm ahead of you niggas, we not no equal
That's the same nigga that broke in them houses
He ain't have no checks so he sat and accounted
21, I had a Challenger
Monitor had 20 thousand, I couldn't even count
My life start changin', these bitches got frantic
These bitches, they see me, they start to panic
Grandma told me better take advantage
Your situation, don't take life for granted
Prayed to the Lord and my prayer got answered
I pulled to the club in a Phantom
'Member when the police bust in, it was random
Fuck it, we took the rap game, held it ransom
Give it up!

[Hook - Quavo]@@@Hit 'Em|||[Hook - Quavo:]
Your bitch look like she want to fuck some
That's what I did when I came in the room and I hit her with the uh (hit it!)
When a nigga hit the plug, when I nigga hit the trap and I hit em with the pump
Look at the pot, look at the egg beater, hit em with the uh (skkrt)
Hit em with it, hit em with it
Hit em with it
Hit em with it, hit em with it
Hit em with it
Hit em with it, hit em with it
Hit em with it
Hit em with it, hit em with it
Hit em with it

[Verse 1 - Quavo:]
Hit it hit it, man I'm tryna stretch it to a whole fifty
Hit the juug, man I'm tryna put you niggas on if you with it
You niggas in your own lane, Migo gang in a division
Hit the pot just for the extras, abracadabra it's missing
Hit the pot, hit it hit it hit it, make em take that like Diddy
Fuck fuck nigga talking, pull up on the block with extensions
Look up the statistics, I'm worth a million
I might pull up in the coupe and hurt your feelings
If you shooting at a nigga, better hit him
Cause you never know, he could come back and hit you

[Hook - Quavo]

[Verse 2 - Offset:]
Hit em with it, remix em
Beat em with it, I'm a go and beat em with it
I won't ever leave it in her
Bullets hit the Sprinter, you sweeter than a cinnamon
I'm checking my agenda, you niggas acting feminine
Had enough to pay my dividends, Migos I'm a citizen
It was evident we had to stay passionate
Pissing diamonds accident, my money is immaculate
Hit em with the tackle
Pull out the chopper, not fronting I'll rush em
Sipping on Actavis in my blood vessel
I am not a mason but I'm rocking Margiella's
Higher than a motherfucker, just like a propeller
I'm riding in the Mulsanne, Bentley got umbrellas
My plug's too far so I tell a nigga mail em

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Takeoff:]
Nigga talking crazy like he want to buck
Hit him with the uppercut, I make him knuckle up
Pull up in the Lamborghini Murcielago to
Make your bitch buckle up, turn me up
Sipping on poison ivy, but nigga check my double cup
My brothers know Isley, tweety bird tweeting in my Bentley truck
Nigga talking bout a check then I'm a run it up
Shots fired at my sprinter bus, bap bap bap, grrrrrrraow
Nobody got hit, it was ten of us
[?], and they pulling up
Pick up the victim, then I point it up
Start busting, ain't no need to load it
I hit the gas, take out their expedition truck

[Hook - Quavo]@@@Buyin 'Em|||[Hook - Quavo:]
Need the whole thing when I'm buyin' 'em
Run and copped the whole bundle when I'm buyin' 'em
I'ma need a whole hundred when I'm buyin' 'em
I'ma need a whole truckload when I'm buyin' 'em
Shut down the whole city when I'm buyin' 'em
Make me feel like Obama when I'm buyin' 'em
Close the whole shop down when I'm buyin' 'em
Make you bring the blocks out when I'm buyin' 'em

[Verse 1 - Quavo:]
Bring a whole damn chicken, I want to buy it
Make 'em bring them whole blocks out and you bite 'em
Pockets on swole, I did it to the hundo breakin' that bowl
Got to buy 'em, when I buy 'em, get the bricks, I circumcise 'em
I got so many juugs on a nigga, I say [?]
Feelin' like the Koreans in Menace to Society
Tellin' them niggas to hurry and buy 'em
Stop tryna walk up on me with them toolies [?] buy 'em
Next time he walk up in my trap
I'ma get a young nigga, go get a nigga, find him

[Hook - Quavo]

[Verse 2 - Offset:]
I'm eyein' it, I'm buyin' it
And if it ain't right I'm denyin' it
I'm 'bout the action, 'bout that violence
And no it ain't no rocket science
Get that pound and then you divide it
Weigh it up on the scale and count, slide it
Point 5 'em, I move in silence
I bought it, it wasn't an issue
Nigga I got 50 thousand dollars worth in tennis shoes
You gotta take an L if you want a fuckin' W
I started in a Super 8, I'm trappin' out the W
Mortal Kombat, fatality, I finish you
Niggas gonna hate on you, can you take the ridicule?
Got a hundred thousand dollars stashed up in the intertube
Got my bitches in the kitchen whippin' up a new

[Hook - Quavo]

[Verse 3 - Takeoff:]
Throwin' up cause my diamonds got me sick as fuck
Carlos in the pickup truck, hop out, 2 Glocks, the block is too hot
Make 'em give it up
Ever since I've been in the kitchen whippin'
Niggas wanna know my formula
Actavis sippin', nigga no prescription
I got the chickens, they're finger lickin'
I'm kickin' the game, I got more white than Barry
Benjamin is my itinerary
That nigga trappin' in December
I'll make a billion by the month of January
2Pac, Makiaveli, Hail Mary
No Nick Cannon, I'm trappin' Mariah Carey
My legacy livin' like Perry Ellis

Nigga can you flip it all, can you make a fifty ball
In the streets I'm a wizard, call me Quavo John Wall
Selling rolls, no Quan, Roll Latifah said it all
Got to have a gas mask in the kitchen cause I cough
Move the work out to Memphis so shout out to Dolph
You niggas is fiction, I know that you false
Rick Ross ain't the only nigga in the world boss
Put the Forgi's on the old school, riding Chevy T-top
When a nigga walk up on me, freeze him like a freeze pop
Feeling like a DJ, hit em with the rerock
Feeling like I'm lost nigga rerock on the D-block
Fucking with the Chi-town niggas out in O-block
Finger fuck the pot, I can make it snow on your block
Nigga just was cooking, that's the reason why the stove hot
Seeing money, in my dreams I had a bank roll knot

I'm a criminal, I got to move my operation
You don't got the money on time, my nigga what's your occupation

Told em As-salamu alaykum cause my niggas kept it sacred
I'm feeling like Big Meech I got a hundred million in my vases
I got GD in my vessel, pistol popping like it's kettle
I can make 100 thousand dollars with no effort
Got a thousand niggas with me, they looking for you like bounties
I'm a put a tax on the gas moving out the county
Sipping active, got me drowsy, trapping, capping, Maui Waui
I got bricks up in the U-haul, I got workers in the mountains
How fast can you count it, my nigga I don't need to count it
You a cannibal, run off with the pack, eat em like animals
Bricks up in Florida, they calling me a Seminole
I know how to move em, Michael Jackson, I'm a smooth criminal

[Hook - Quavo]

[Verse 3 - Takeoff:]
Drinking on Activis, whip the work then I'm packing it
100K in the attic, I got the bricks in the cabinet
Though the work is immaculate, I be trapping and dabbing it
On the island I'm cooling it, had the kush in my Loubotins
It's an intruder in the window, I'm shooting, fly to Bermuda
Pull up with choppers with the coolers in it
I'm trapping, got a half a bag but don't know what to do with it
Fuck a milli, bet a thou'll make your bitch get loose with it
Selling out arenas, fuck a nigga's city up, we used to it
They never seen 100 thousand cause you niggas new to it
QC that's the label got a solid foundation
My nigga trapping out vacants, we smoking gas like Jamaica
Black and white Bentley Musalnne but I am not racist
Traveling around the world to go get Benjamin faces
If you ain't talking bout money then I get aggravated
Get up out my face if you ain't talking Benji Franklins
Taking trips across the nation

Soda pop booty, she poppin' her booty like popcorn, and it's wobblin'
Wanna take her home, when I get in the room, when I get the pussy, I'm a dive in it
She make me wanna have a million babies, when she poppin' the booty, hop-scotchin' it

Freaky deaky, pussy drippin', leakin'
White girls, I got jungle fever
Her booty jumpin', every beat out the speaker
Hit her one time, then I leave with the leader
Run around, jump up and down like a pogo
I brought the camera, we might make a porno
I had to pop her up, my game for a makeover
Private jet to LA, we don't do layovers
Piercings in her nipple, piercings in her dimple, pop it like a pimple
She nasty, bet you didn't know her daddy a pastor, laughter
She in my trap while she poppin' the castle
Speed it up, then she go slow
Grippin' that pussy, do the tootsie roll
She go harder than the concrete
Italian tailor, Givenchey
Money longer than a bungy
All this damn gold like a treasury
Lick on me like I am licorice
Burkin bag, she an expensive bitch
She ratchet, she still got the kinky twist
Pop it, pop it, in my Bentley bitch

Wiped the semen off with a napkin

[Hook - Offset]

[Verse 2 - Quavo:]
I came to party, I drink lean, no Bacardi
OG gas stank so bad it smell like somebody farted
Old school Chevy t-top you can have the Ferrari
Wanna party all night, take molly all night, got a white girl screamin' gnarly
Stop lookin' over here, can't get in V.I.P
Wanna put the molly all up on your lips
Got a nice ass, got some nice hips
Wanna hop up in a nigga's spaceship
Wanna party
If you get out of line, I'm a shoot up the party
Pull up to the valet, gotta park a nigga Bugatti
When I hop off Versace, Giuseppe my toe, I got guap in my pocket
Look at my wrist, it got boogers on it, gotta know that they sloppy
Everybody welcome to my party, no Illuminati
No 2Pac, no Snoop Dogg, welcome to the gangster party

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Takeoff:]
I came to party, 3 bitches menagin'
2 bitches give me back rubs
I want massages
You see yacht party on the islands
No Nick Cannon, but these bitches be wylin'
Ric Flair, how a nigga be stylin'
She suckin' and fuckin', you know her pussy got mileage
White bitches, snow bunnies, Mileys, bootin on molly
When they see me, get excited
Trap party, trappin' and dabbin' up at the Hyatt
007 James Bond, I'm movin' in silence
Niggas just like the ashes figured I try it
I'm feelin' like a doctor, all these fuckin' clients
Ya'll should bag it up, a young nigga get behind it
My jeweler up in the cooler you cannot find it
Before you walk my trap, I'm checkin' for the wires
I'm in the jungle with bears and lions and tigers
When I first seen a [?], nigga got inspired
A nigga trap in the nighttime, no Michael Myers
I be stackin' my money tall as the Eiffel Tower
Pull up on the block, I had to Forgiato my tires
Came to party with my niggas, they be gettin' it
Came to party with my bitches gettin' freaky
Hit the pussy with the right don't call me rookie
Benjamin Franklin takin' off bikinis

[Hook - Offset]@@@Bachelor|||[Hook - Quavo:]
Mansion full of bachelors
Flippin' all these hoes like a spatula
Nah, you know I don't like no camera
Nah, your bitch she like an animal attackin' us
She won't leave me 'lone, she love the bachelor
Migos, young rich nigga, we some bachelors
Bachelors, bachelor, bachelors, ooh bachelor
Bachelors, bachelors, uh, bachelors, Migos some bachelors

[Quavo:]
Quavo, I am a bachelor
Look at the way I'm dabbin' like a pastor (I'm dabbin' ain't it)
I am a bachelor
Rockin' the shows, smashin' hoes right after
You know I'm a bachelor
Got your bitches workin', calling me master
Came from the bottom and now I got guala
Turn the page, my nigga, we on the next chapter
Trapper turned rapper
Graduated, now a nigga's a bachelor
Flippin' your ho like a spatula
Don't get me wrong, I still whip up with spatulas
Your ho was creeping like tarantulas
Migos we don't like the cameras
We find out that we can make millions with it
So we started flexin' like bachelors
Came from stashing money in a ceilin'
Young niggas why don't you wanna be bachelors?
They came from kicking doors, drinkin' purp from the bowl
And now we taking trips to Africa, Africa
Niggas say that they are entrepreneurs
I go and see the millions that you pursuin'
Statistics ain't black and white, what is you doin'?
Top the charts every time we drop a new one

[Hook]

[Takeoff:]
Migos, we some bachelors, we pull up in tarantulas
Whippin' the dope, we the Terminator break the spatula
Get the pack and then I wrap it up and then I bag it up
If I catch a mug I'll take a private jet to Canda
Promoters ain't got my money, I'm shootin' up your manager
Fuck it my nigga, we shootin' innocent bystanders
My niggas on top of the mountain, no Grand Canyon
Pull up with choppas and make a nigga call the ambulance
Drinkin' on Actavis and I'm rollin' up cannabis
Hoes runnin' 'round the lobby geekin' up and their panties wet
I had a cuban link and Rolex before the rap shit
I just adapt to the trap cause that's my habitat
I'm in the corner catchin' the work like a cornerback
Runnin' to the money, my nigga, think I'm a running back
Niggas still trappin' quarters, make 'em give their quarter back
Forty pointers in my Breitling, oh that's what you lookin' at?

[Hook]

[Offset:]
Pull up to the mansion, 50 story, hundred rooms
She lookin' at my diamond solution, that ain't no shrooms
Hold a nigga rest and beat his head in with a broom
Had that brotha be flyin' like caterpillars out cocoons
Penthouse elevator, it'll elevate yah
Pull up in the Bentley, think you seen a fuckin' Jeeper Creeper
Got that 9 on my waist like a two-way beeper
Got that purse on your head, nigga like a alopecia
I'm a bachelor, I got a oil factory in Africa
Trapper turned rapper then rapper turned into a massacre
Then beat a nigga, stomp a nigga, I will not account
From the beginning these bitches, they wasn't shit, they ate the apple
I had a warrant with the sack, the police tried to make a tackle
Green Bay with the green, vacuum seal it, I'm a Packer
Just because you rap about it, you are not a trapper
Just because you got a milli, you are not a bachelor

[Hook]@@@Naw FR|||[Hook - Quavo:]
Your bitch, she wet, she leakin' (naw forreal)
Don't fuck with you niggas, you sneakin' (naw forreal)
Can't turn my back on the hood, need me (naw forreal)
When you gettin' money, stack it up for a reason (naw forreal)
Take a look at my life back then, trap season (naw forreal)

My family need me (naw forreal, forreal)
My squad let me lead 'em (naw forreal, forreal)

[Verse 1 - Quavo:]
Keep this bitch ass nigga off of from 'round me, naw forreal

Want to live the Migo life? It's hard to live
Want to walk in my shoes? That is hard to fill
Naw forreal, man you know that we made a mil'
Independent, I cease and desist your deal
You niggas trippin' cause you out of business
And we came in the game so fast, we're professionals
Started doin' shows at mansions and obsessions
You seen it, everybody know, they witnessed
Nah forreal, R.I.P. my nigga Pistol P
I know he send a nigga down blessings
Now I wanna walk around on the north
Nigga gotta keep the MAC 10

[Hook - Quavo]

[Verse 2 - Offset:]
Naw forreal, really had to sit down and do some time
Naw forreal, young rich nigga got rich off of a halftime
The block be beatin' like Alpine, forreal, 200 for the [?]
Stand at the stove, whip a slab, that's a cookie slab
Police tried to get me for a case, I had an alibi
Nah, fuck niggas you a lie
Real hitta, [?]
Forreal we were hot boys
Put the gun up in your mouth like Altoids
Trapper start snappin', gotta be a damn poet
We ain't ho-in' no lean, go ahead and pour it
Skinny tires on the Rolls we lookin' bow legged
I'm a bachelor, I live in a mansion that's gated
40 for the [?]

[Hook - Quavo]

[Verse 3 - Takeoff:]
Naw forreal, pints double sealed
And the OG air bag come vacuum sealled
Remember kickin' in your door takin' flats
And the door stickin' out at my grandma crib
Trap on the block where the [?] see the snow
Young nigga tryna make a dope deal
They askin' me questions like Dr. Phil
Got excited when I seen a half a mil'
I was playin' just to get a record deal
Now we independent, worth a couple M's
Came a long way from bustin' out sticks and stems
It's a lot of shit that I regret I did
Can't let negativity get to me
I take a private jet to Sicily
So you the grinch who stole Christmas
I got the OG gasbag Christmas tree

[Hook - Quavo]@@@Story I Tell|||[Hook - Quavo:]
Dope on the scale, man you never seen it
Hundred band juug, no you never hit it
You never been down the road to riches
This the story I tell so you pay attention
Cold turkey, yeah we had to eat it
So I take the pot and fucking beat it
You never been down the road to riches
Take your pen and your pad cause you gonna need it
Trap money, me and my dogs spend it
Your bitch, me and my dogs hit it
Drop the head on the Bentley then fall in it
When we dropped Versace, then y’all did it
They hate that we came from the Northside
Then linked in the city, got mob ties
They hate that we came in with plenty jewels
Young nigga just dabbin' first day of school

[Quavo:]
Remember the days with the pocket rockets
Turned the bando to a fucking hot pocket
It’s a million dollars in the corner pocket
I just share the rock like I’m John Stockton
African diamonds, Olajuwon, Houston Rockets
My niggas they got 'stendos on their guns, they go up out it
Ain’t no need to talk about it
Megaton trucks, it don’t weigh enough
Had to take out the plug, he was switching up
You mad cause your label do finger fucks
QC the label got mega bucks
Gas off in the back of the spinner bus
Say that you trapping, really you got touch and bust
This is the life of the Hefty bags
You know that them ounces don’t weigh enough

[Hook]

[Takeoff:]
I came a long way from dropping the fishes
Finessing the plug for his riches
Wake up in the morning, I go grab the spatula
Walk in the kitchen and whip me a chicken
Her wrist is a Masi, my neck is a Bentley
Blue Benjamins that can pay your tuition
Lupe said that Activis been discontinued
Double cup, a nigga still be sipping
Got a plug out in Mississippi
Wrap it up, ship it to Finland
I trap out the bando, don’t trap out the trap house
And whatever you with, we with it
Came a long way from that midget
Money taller than a midget
I keep the mac like a midget
Mama we made us a milli, we did it
Fuck the negativity, fuck the critics

[Hook]

[Offset:]
They hate that that money start coming
And I be too fresh, I call it double mints
I was on the block, you was on punishment
Giuseppe stepping, and my diamonds they compliments
QC my label, and that’s my establishment
Supercharge my Bentley, I call it Clark Kent
Me and my niggas spread the butter, margarine
Marvin the Martian, got Raris, I cut off the engines
Now park it
You can catch a bullet in your carcass
100 band juug, and you wasn’t a part
I took the plug off and we had a departure
You telling a story bout me, I’m the author
These bitches be choosing, they digging my posture
Whipping babies, I’m not talking bout toddlers
Similac in on these baby bottles
Little babies get stepped on they call me stepfather

[Hook]@@@Nawfside|||[Hook - Quavo:]
Wake up in the morning, gotta thank God
Walking out the bando with a.45
Shake a 7/11 in the dog pound
It's just another day on the North side
I'm for real, nigga, you can ask about us, nigga
We earn stripes on the North side
Just another day, just another day
Just another day on the North
Real talk, nigga
I know niggas took a loss, nigga
On the North side, it's just another day on the North side
On the North, it's just another day on the North side

[Quavo:]
It's just another day, what is a day on the north?
Wake up in the morning, they kick in the door
We looking for money, we looking for gold
My niggas 100, my niggas on go
My niggas is trapping, dapping, what is you having?
Run with the sack and I go hit the hole
They calling me Quavo McFadden, no John Madden
I run the game
Look at my house, take a long at my ring
Walk in the North and I know I got rank
Pull up in the North and remember the day
I play the game like a game of spades
And I took me a flight to the Everglades
I told 'em that day that it was my way and never get paid of 50k

[Hook]

[Takeoff:]
Nigga, they bucking, they rubbing, they sacking
Taking the pounds and breaking them down
What a beautiful day, my AK came equipped with 100 rounds
Niggas talking like they got the crown
Find their body in the lost and found
Chopper louder than surround sound
It's an undercover in the underground
Just another day on the North side rollin' (rolling)
Riding around trying to get it in, 2Pac all eyes on me (2Pac)
My young nigga hit a 100 band jug and the car belt was stolen
Young nigga still strapped by the North side
Gwinnett County patrolling

[Hook]

[Offset:]
Trapping on Club Drive, Migos the Army got Mob ties
We hit the ground, we had to do time
Kick in the door a million times
My nigga Westside he had to do five
The hood were crying when Pistol Pete died
You gotta survive, the streets will eat you alive
They say we wear make up, but that was a lie
Broke in them houses, no burglar bars
You said that you hard, you niggas are frauds
I went to the pen and them times were hard
I got a bulldog and it's gonna bark
You niggas is bitches, you wear leotards
Bitches they mad cause I broke their heart
Needed college, I didn't go to Clark
Beating the pot like it's martial arts

[Hook]@@@Ain't Mine|||[Hook - Quavo:]
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Stop claimin' me bitch, you know you lyin'
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
You can have that little bitty bitch, you know she ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine

[Verse 1 - Takeoff:]
Most of these bitches they ain't mine, nigga
You can have that bitch, I swear she ain't no dime, nigga
She no quarter, I won't spoil her
Think she Moses when she cross the water
Immigrant, she cross the border
How the fuck niggas say they can afford my business?
It's the same niggas rockin' Jordans
Pull up Trailblazer, like I'm in Portland
White boy shoot better than Kyle Korver
300 Spartans, my niggas immortal
Sellin' fishes, I got Nemo and Dory
In the swamp with gators like I'm in Florida
Tryna get rich like Richard Porter
Takin' that Pyrex pot and glass bowl
And stickin' my hand in that water
If the bitch try to take a quarter
It gon' be a homicide, Law and Order
It's cheaper to leave her
But it's gon' cost you some money if you wanna spoil her
She got that Aquafina, call her water
She wanna ride on top of my Sequoia

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Offset:]
You cuffin' your ho and I'm fuckin' your ho
Like a light, she can switch
Sloppy toppy, eat it, licorice
Wipe the gloss off your lip when you suck the dick
Why you claimin' a nigga? You know you ain't mine
It's time to cut her off, it's 'bout that time
Why the fuck you keep lyin'? You a little fine
I'm not wastin' my time, only spend with dimes
She got the audacity say that we're married
Chasin' a nigga like Tom & Jerry
Look how she standin', she Halle Berry
I laugh at the bitch like I'm Tyler Perry
Your birthday, be singin' like Mary Mary
She say she a virgin, don't got a cherry
I'm not fuckin' no bitch if the pussy hairy
I'm passin' your bitch like a Hail Mary
She wanna claim me cause I'm famous
Mexico groupie bitches, they be dangerous
Immigrant bitches, they don't speak our language
I don't fight over bitches, I leave your shirt painted
Innocent bitches, they look like a model
Shaped like a bottle, they suck and they swallow
Lil' mama, she bad so niggas gon' holla
And shouts out lil' mama, she only fuck ballers

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Quavo:]
You can have, she ain't mine
No, I don't want her
I don't want her
Yes she's foreign, I caught her in Barcelona
Got this Spanish lil' mama, like to drink Corona
But you can have her, she gon' instantly bend it over
Cuffin' bitches, I ain't worried 'bout it
Cause everybody know about it
I pulled up to my mansion in the Audi
Smashed and then she outtie
Say she from New York, I had to call my nigga Rosh
He told me that she goin' in, she got that sloppy toppy
So you know what I did?
I got her suckin' me up in a Benz
She told me she wanted a threesome
I told that lil' bitch call her friend
When I pull, light the light, the Forgis slide
You must be blind if this money you think ain't mine

[Hook]@@@Wishy Washy|||[Hook - Quavo:]
You know these hoes wishy washy
They'll fuck your partner
Take all of your guala, take your guala
You know these hoes wishy washy
They hop in my bed, they can't wait to open their legs
They walk in the mall, they can't wait to spend all my bread
Wishy washy, wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy
Wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy
Wishy washy, I can not trust them
Wishy washy, I can not love them
You gotta watch them, these hoes wishy washy

[Verse 1 - Quavo:]
Let me tell you a story
'Bout this lil' bit named Tamar
She'll let you smash for sure today
And then smash your partner tomorrow
She'll ask you can you take care of her
That'll cost you 'bout a couple hundred dollars
Everybody know lil' mama on go
Everybody call her hundred gobbler
Got hoes on hoes like a rasta
Is it because of my posture?
But I know it's cause a nigga's dollars
She got a baby, no, I'm not the father
She too wishy washy, she'll go in your pocket
And break your wallet, and you know she got it
But I got the knowledge to go tell her stop it
And she shake like an 8 hit a corner pocket
You can not play me
You know you're too wishy washy
Kick her out the house politely
We noticed you was too excited
No we not going for it, no we not going
You're too wishy washy lil' bitch and you know it
Ain't got time for a kid, the lil' bitch at the front door

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Offset:]
These hoes wishy washy
Ain't no doubt about it
Quick to put your finger in a young nigga's wallet
And I know you fuckin' my partner
Quick to fuck a nigga for a couple hunna
High class pimpin' these niggas, she got the formula
Suckin' my anaconda, got the flower aroma
And on my mama I'm not fuckin' these bitches without a condom
Wishy washy
Cut these bitches off like hibachi
I'm fuckin' her and her whole posse
If you wanna fuck her then you gotta pay deposit
She givin' up her pussy for the profit
Her mama keep beggin' her to stop it
She really wanna be on red carpets
These bitches ain't shit, it's in the Bible
Talkin' 'bout you got a baby in your stomach
These bitches are funny
They're tryna take a nigga's money
I ain't got no feelings for no bitches, I'm numbing
Up to par, my swag from London
These bitches bad, ain't worth nothin'
I'm just sayin', I can see your plan
You wanna get married to a rich man

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Takeoff:]
I can't fuck with you bitches, you wishy washy
Neiman Marcus shoppin', she want me to spoil her rotten
But I know that she's plottin' mama said don't trust nobody
This bitch is a vegetarian, all she want is broccoli
I told her if she knew better, she would prolly do better
That Rolex is a Skylander, got gold all on my Margielas
Pullin' up in a Bentley, no Mr. Bentley
She askin' me where my umbrella
Fox fur, put on my mink, chinchilla
Flawless diamonds, it's gon' be a cold winter, burr, burr
Don't wanna fuck you, lil' mama, I just want head
These bitches, they can't wait to open their legs
But soon as she pull in my driveway
Pull up to my front door, she got the panties in her hand
She know how to work the pots and pans
She watchin' me like I'm on demand
She the bomb, Osama Bin (Osama Bin Laden!)

[Hook]@@@All Good|||[Pre-Hook - Takeoff:]
Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I'm a come home
She telling me that I be fucking bitches
And I told her that she trippin'
Cause you must be high off shrooms
Want to investigate me when I come in the room
Talking bout where you been at
And why you ain't pick up your phone?
I've been on the road stacking money
Talking bout I treat her Macaulay Culkin
Cause she stay at home alone
But it's all good though

[Hook - Takeoff:]
When I come in with them M&Ms
And tell you to count up this big bankroll
Everything good though
Told me stop trapping but you told me
That you wanna get up out the hood though
All my hard work, it done paid off
Shawty stayed down since day one
Got to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun
Put on my jewelry baby, shine like the sun

[Verse 1 - Takeoff:]
Ok I be on a private jet to Portuguese to just pick up some Benjamin Franklins
From some people I ain't never seen
The OGs keep telling me boy you gon make history
Told my bitch you better ask about a nigga in these streets
We can go to MIA to see the palm trees
Lamborghini, man we pull up on Daytona Beach
When I look into her eyes I make her panties leak
She still probably won't believe so we taking a trip to go to Belize
But it's all good though

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Quavo:]
Quavo talk to em' ooh
You know you're shining baby
Looking like some VVS diamonds baby
Want to thank your mama, my God what a creation
Wanna welcome you into my mansion with an invitation
I'm a young nigga, ain't used to relations
So you know I ain't patient
She told me she black and she Asian
Look how she walk when she came in
She hate it when I got to go on the road
But she like it when I bring back the hundos
She cooking spaghetti and gumbo
Mama told me don't eat no sauce from no hoes
But you know a nigga really like you
But you tryna shut down my empire
That's my lifestyle, like the wire
You too bipolar, baby you fire

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Offset:]
I had to fly out to Vegas to show her that I'm a player
I'm not used to cuffing the women but I'm gonna save her
Booty fatter than Deelishis, when I hit her we lay up
We together, get up on our knees and we say our prayers
Ain't no trials and tribulations, we having some patience
25 she got two cars, and a house that she pays for
So what else could I ask for, first night I was mad, I didn't smash
And that taught me a lesson, lil mama got to be special
She just want to kick it with me, we can travel wherever
She know I got a busy schedule, sometimes she be acting selfish
When I hit her she be quitting cause she say it's too much pleasure
She telling me her favorite song is Handsome and Wealthy
She love it when I'm kissing on her body, start to melt her
I be murdering the pussy, I should have another felon
We sticking together just like we salt and pepper
But it's all good though

What y'all doin'? What y'all doin'?
Gotta make a difference in your own hood
Feel like Will Smith, I see millions, I'm gonna pursue it
If my momma told me if I came up short it's all good
No I had to tell my mom sorry, I could picture me in that 'Rari
After all the pain that we went through
I don't even wanna rewind it
Free all my niggas went down in the system
Send the Green Dot cause I miss 'em
R.I.P. my nigga Pistol, can't believe the bullet hit him
Sometimes a young nigga might wanna cry
But I can't let you niggas see it
It was in my soul takin' flats and gold
Juugin' round the city for no reason
Juug Season, that's what a young nigga called it, Juug Season
In the jungle, I survived every season

[Hook - Quavo]

[Verse 2 - Offset:]
What are you doin'? You had money, you blew it
You had dreams on the court, didn't have no support
All these niggas they stuck in the system
Police keep killin' my people
Trap on the block with the reefer
Tryin' to count up the monifa
Beating the pot I might sneak her
Used to kick doors for new sneakers
Can't trust no bitch cause the sneakin'
I step out that, shoot through your back call you Ricky
Now I got riches so bitches they miss me
Wanna know what you been doin' all this time
Why you ain't got no money on your mind
Together we stand, we fall apart then we divide
Fuck the police we might start up a riot
This shit is so pitiful, had to pay money for my nigga's funeral
That was my nigga we had so much unity
I got in my heart, he on top and he smilin'
Used to talk about a fuckin' rivalry
What about police that take a bribery?
They don't give a fuck about people in poverty
Don't got no property
This a democracy, no apology

[Hook - Quavo]

[Verse 3 - Takeoff:]
Some of my niggas on the block right now
Most of my niggas kick doors right now
Run up on a nigga tryna rob, got a 100 round drum right now
Most of my niggas court, judge don't drop the hammer down
No Tony Parker, I came a long way from that starter
I'm thanking God cause I never had to ride that Marta
Now my diamonds flawless, make a nigga nauseous
That nigga fresher than Carlton, tryna fuck on Ms. Parker
Remember wanna be a monster, niggas playin' cops and robbers
Ever since a youngin' I was a problem
I was a leader, never was a follower
I got your ho in my condo, she poppin' it
You niggas bitches, you niggas be gossiping'
If a nigga want it, I'ma go get it
My nigga we break it we split it
We takin' riches cause niggas jumpin' them fences@@@Struggle|||[Hook - Quavo:]
Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain't nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that's the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Call it the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle

[Verse 1 - Quavo:]
Got to survive, the struggle
I had to get my money cause I ain't have no muscle
My squad gon ride that's because I trust em
If he want to die, know my squad gon bust him
If they ain't with us then my nigga fuck em
It's a struggle in my hood, blue Benjamins, I touch em
RIP to Mike Brown, I heard my nigga fuck with us
Middle finger to the police dare them niggas fuck with us (Fuck 12!)
I got all these chains, I'm representing slavery
Only listen to my God and mama, that's who made me
When my brother [?] called my phone, that shit was crazy
RIP my brother Pistol Pete, let em know we made it
Mama told me that she can't visit me in the pen
She want to break me out and I can't see her going in
I swear to God you might ain't seen it
But if you been through the struggle I know you feel this

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Takeoff:]
See the struggle is a motherfucker
Nigga tryna hit me for my chain, but I ain't gon let him touch it
Go to any state, walk through your hood and I ain't got to tuck em
Swear to God if you touch my brother I ain't gon hesitate to bust ya
Niggas see you getting money, plotting, tryna take it from ya
It'll hurt you if you know your right hand man, he telling on you
Break down me a Backwood, rolling me a blunt of marijuana
OutKast in my Backwood, young nigga smoking on Stankonia
Remember plugging up that George Foreman
Early in the morning eat leftovers
I had to warm it, now a young nigga eat steak and shrimp and Benihanas
I remember ten piece chicken nuggets from McDonalds
I remember mama said get up, go get that money
Stand solid, never let another nigga take it from you
I told you mama, now you got that mansion that you wanted
I came a long way from renting the Audi, now I own it
Rest in peace Ree-Ree and Pistol Pete, the top is lonely

[Hook - Quavo]

[Verse 3 - Offset:]
First free my brothers, we used to build the mansions in the house with covers
He used to beat me, told me nigga get some muscle
If you can't beat em then you gonna have to bust em
It was a struggle, grandma dead, man I really wish I could hug her
Migo gang la familia, so fuck the other
I told my mama I got her back when I lost my brother
Locked up for a strap said I wasn't going back and I still got in trouble
If you got the sack then my niggas kidnap, call my niggas, they gutter
Packing the dope, we kickin' in your door, we looking for the gold
Keep the forties on my hip, the heater because the world is so cold
Get the money, fuck the bitches, nigga that's the number one goal
If a nigga want a pull up then a nigga got to be bold
Five racks, hit him with the chopper, nigga you got to go
You niggas is hoes when the pistol shows, you getting exposed
Givenchy my toe, I came out that bowl, I lived on the stove

[Hook - Quavo]@@@Memoirs|||[Intro - Quavo, (Offset) & Takeoff:]
Aye Offset (yo), aye Takeoff, what's up, homes?
You remember that shit we did way way way back in the day?
(I remember that) Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work
We was some crazy young niggas huh?

[Bridge - Takeoff:]
I'd like to welcome you to Yung Rich Nation
I know you been patiently waiting
Yung Rich Nation that's the album
Tryna turn the mansion to a castle

[Hook - Quavo & (Offset):]
Diamond shine came from Africa, shine, shine (Africa)
(Young Rich Niggas we some bachelors) Ooh, damn, bachelor
Turn the club to a massacre (fuck it up, fuck the club up)
(If you a broke nigga I'm sad at ya, pitiful) Sad to say

[Verse 1 - Quavo & Offset:]
First check bought a Audi Coupe
It was black and grey like the Raiders
First check bought a Challenger
It was 10 bands so I paid it
Remember the time, Offset he got me high
That was right by the neighbors house?
Remember the time we broke in the neighbors house
That was our first paper route
Remember the time they shot up my mama house
12 tried to make it my fault
Remember the time you niggas laughed at me
Said that I wouldn't bond out
You say that you trappin', take you to the bando
And you a front see whatchu 'bout
Before we made the song Hit Em' with it
We was knockin' niggas out
Before we made the song 'Birds', pelicans fly to the south
Niggas talkin' stupid up in crowd
Jumped in the crowd and punched em' in the mouth
First time we in Miami, we had a gangsta shootout
Dope in my sock, and we beat the trap out
Don't come in my trap if you unannounced

[Hook - Quavo & Offset:]
Diamond shine came from Africa (Shine, shine, Africa)
Young Rich Niggas we some bachelors (Ooh, dab, bachelor)
Turn the club to a massacre (fuck it up, fuck the club up)
If you a broke nigga I'm sad at ch'ya (pitiful, sad to say)

[Verse 2 - Takeoff:]
Remember the time, I did my first breaking in?
Me, myself & I ain't had nobody with me
Cause I ain't want my uncles know I did it
Remember the time I got kicked out for havin' gas stashed in my locker?
In the gym choppin' it up with my partners
Next thing you know got walked out by the coppers
First juug I hit at school, Lord please forgive me
I know you remember that
6 peer plotted on my teacher had to hit for that fundraiser fetti pack
Got home and counted the check
I'm thinkin' to myself Takeoff what you gon' do with that
Call the plug up ask him where he at
I'm celebratin' smokin' back to back
Remember that time Quavo came home with a full grown marijuana plant
Stackin' up the crib tryin' dry it off in the oven it was still wet
Mama came in smelt the odor said "Damn boy I can catch contact"
I got that dope talkin' anthrax, [?] when we hit for fifty racks

[Hook - Quavo & Offset:]
Diamond shine came from Africa (Shine, shine, Africa)
Young Rich Niggas we some bachelors (Ooh, dab, bachelor)

Yeah, ahhh
Lemme talk my shit, nigga
Migo, huh
Fuck wrong with these niggas, nigga?

[Verse 1 - Quavo:]
When I caught the coupe they was mad at me
Hoes calling me the dab daddy (I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy)
Bettin' poker chips, I ain't playin' man (I ain't playin' man and I ain't playin' sticks)
I'm a rich nigga, you can check my status (You can check my status, you can check the stats)
Pass chemistry, fuck mathmatics (Fuck mathmatics, I ain't pass school)
My money counter do the adding (Money counter do the rules)
I bought a carpet from Aladdin (I bought a carpet from Aladdin)
So I can finesse and do magic (So I can fly and finesse, nigga)
Rammin' the engine in traffic
Lost Mike and Pete, that's tragic (R.I.P., damn)

[Hook - Quavo:]
I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy
I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy
Hoes calling me the dab daddy
Hoes calling me the dab daddy

[Verse 2 - Offset:]
Offset!
From the jail cell, my wrist so sick it got sickle cells
Working my wrist like a ferris wheel, you say this and that while my pockets filled
We don't spare no nigga, cut his head off and show me his real
We got diamonds and gold, ain't no stainless steel
Independant, we didn't take a deal
I know you heard about the fight, I know you heard about the shooting, I know you heard a nigga ruthless
Thirty thousand for a viewing
Bitch you see the dab
Tipping Margielas, you do the math
When I pull up on Beverly shopping, I pull up in a Phantom, not in a cab
Red bottom drippin' it's a blood bath
Ferragamo, arrested for my dab
Say I'm the dab daddy with my dabbin' ass
Fucked your bitch once, I give her back!

[Hook - Quavo:]
I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy
I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy
Hoes calling me the dab daddy
Hoes calling me the dab daddy

[Verse 3 - Takeoff:]
Dab! Dab! On top of dab
Takeoff in the kitchen like I'm Dexter's Lab
Walk in the mall and I dip in Ge'
Swappin', no swappin', no check the tag
Gas better sewed up, bitch you wanna take self
Dicking it up, never not fuck they momma, they call me Mel
Rich nigga but I know we have some in wealth
Takeoff is spillin' Actavis on new Margielas
Everywhere I go they call me dab daddy
Dab daddy, got different, different dab
Flippin' dab like a acrobat
Flippin' it, flippin' it, flippin' 'em
2500 my tapestry, I got expensive habits (Actavis, Actavis, Actavis)
Throw body parts on my Murciélago, pull up like Go Go Gadget
Pull up in valet, the [?] do magic
Dippin', dabbin' in the Phantom, lookin' at the roof and it's panoramic
Diamonds clear water like they from Atlantic
Dab daddy, I'm the king of the fashion!

[Hook - Quavo:]
I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy
I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy
Hoes calling me the dab daddy
Hoes calling me the dab daddy@@@Migos Origin|||[Intro:]
So what part of Atlanta y'all from?
From the north side
Uh, yeah
Every show get crazy and crazy
We growing and growing every, every, every time at a show

[Chorus - Quavo:]
Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up

[Verse 1 - Quavo:]
We killed the Versace, we went to Bahamas, shout out to the islands
Mommas and daughters taking a picture with me and they smiling
Charlemagne say the gang Donkey of the Day (Charlamagne?)
Billboard magazine, 45K
Word on the street they say the Migos wanted
But they can't find the Migos, so they bite their recorders
When you ask for a show, can you seriously afford it
Check my schedule, itinerary loaded of course
Check my dab, it's priceless
And my niggas is righteous
I don't got no type, but I love to fuck Pisces
The chains on my neck, I might get arthritis
YRN Tha Album first album going diamond
Got my mama a Benz
Just to show her I'm grinding
Green dots in the pen but I hate the confinement
When Offset got out of jail he ate a bowl of hundreds
Dropped the Rich Nigga Timeline and we was crossed the country

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Offset:]
Skrrt, cook up
Graat, he shook up
I'm trapping the white, that Ku Klux
My niggas got grenades and bazookas
On the private jet we smoking up in indica
A hundred thousand, got a pick up in India
Headed to locker, we changed the millennium
Thirty thousand for a walk through minimum
Snakes in the grass start spinning out venom
That come with the territory when a nigga winning
Tinted windows on the sprinter you don't need to see this image
The blogs say I need to calm down, fuck a image
Your CEO a busta and my CEO a hustler
Choppa sound like percussion, run up on me repercussion
Came from nothing, came home with a half a million, hurt my stomach
I'm taking good care of my kids but they mamma get nothing
And if you think it's wrong this ain't the right song you're bumping
Welcome to the jungle, lions, elephants and monkeys
Never see me lonely, best believe nina on me
Stuffed crust, my pocket walking with a 50 on me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Takeoff:]
Pyrex pot on the stove, take that eggbeater cook up
They looking for the origin, wanna know how did we make this shit up
Came in there right and we fucking it up
Jump off the banana boat, call me King Tut
Niggas be biting our swag I tried to switch it up
But these niggas still don't get enough
Niggas with attitude don't give a fuck
Young nigga flexing never did a push up
Migo flow everybody wanna look it up
Every ten years it's on my story bro
I bet you listen up, you don't gotta like it
Yo favorite rapper he be biting
When I step in the booth, it's a moment of silence
I bet yo bitch she get excited
When I'm doing show my front end and that back end be enormous
I need a double cup with my Backwood when I'm on stage performing
Can't get in my tour bus bitch, ain't tryna fuck, it's only 5 in the morning
I got some Dominican bitches that sucking and fucking and back to the origin

[Chorus]@@@Spray The Champagne|||[Intro:]

We thank you; for giving the young niggas the crown

[Verse 1 - Quavo:]

Ridin' for the task force, my lifestyle like a rodeo horse
Had a dream in a porsche then I woke up and had to go to court
Got a lawyer, dropped the cases, now you see me on the pages
XXL magazine, December and shoe cover Fader
They sayin' Migos better than the Beatles
Paul McCartney, I would like to meet him
Young niggas from the Northside with Leon Korol havin' brunch meetings
Huncho, where the fam?, I got to feed 'em, private jet in the six seater
Quavo livin' legend, Elvis, that's why I pull up leakin' continental, gone!

Street nigga just want a Beamer
On the Northside, police give us a pinger
Pistol in the locker, give 'em the ringer
Grandma was a sacrifice, can't forget
We can see the far shit and we with it
Trappin' out the bando, behind the door was a semi
Real got the squad, Quavo whip it scientific
Juggin' iPhones, so we made a half a ticket
Real street nigga sacrifice
And you in the trap, watch out for the mice

Choppas eat you niggas like a termite
Bloody money turn to clean money
Fiend money that got bean money
I seen money and I dream money
Listerine, why should I clean money?

Gotta thank God for my life, shit that happen over night
We're respected, Migos Gang, we rep this worldwide, takin' nine hour flights
When you a young rich nigga, you do what you like
Want a feature, nigga?, Gotta pay the price
Pourin' act in the cream soda, fuck the sprite
Cut the lights off and in the club, my diamonds bright
In the kitchen with the envy then hop Lamborghini, that's a two seater
Work come from Columbia, name it Adelina
Might just take a trip, just go to Januvia

So the nigga I don't like made a move to the right
I grabbed the Glock and point it at him on sight
The nigga to the left told me put the gun down
BOW one round, Uh, it's going down
I ran out the store, I can't believe I ain't hit
My migos pull up with macs and sticks
Rel hopped out and let 2 shots off
Then I looked around the corner it's Gwinnett County law
I rolled down the window, it's the officer
Put his nose in my car, he say he smell the herb
He opened up the door and asked me can he search?
Hell Naw, officer you know how much I'm worth?

Mirror, when do you picture the Migos falling off?
The mirror said you stupid boy, don't ask that question at all

Got me all in your walls, I'm tryna knock down the tower
I'm not really involved with buying gifts and the flowers
She see my diamond it dancing, they globing into your water, like top me off
Tried to kiss me, fuck that, and call her again, she lost
It's only for one night cause I know that you not really worth it
If I text you tomorrow you gonna be asking for Birkin
Don't be involved in your feelings cause obsolete bitches hurting
I gots to get me a condom cause I don't want no more garbage
I'm in the Maybach with curtains, she suck me up like a sherbert
We fucking these bitches with the lights on
And we don't fuck under cover

[Hook - Chris Brown:]
I want you, you want me
Just for tonight
(Only one night)
Just for tonight
(Just for tonight)
I want you baby (you)
And you want me (me)
Just for tonight
One night (one night, one night)
Yo@@@Pipe It Up|||[Chorus x2 - Quavo:]
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up

[Verse 1 - Quavo:]
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
She was a basic bitch til I piped her up
I'm just doing my dab, I called it the pipe it up
They know that I'm having blue Benjamin's
They know I'm on top of the pyramid
They know I'm a go down in Guinness
All this dab a nigga drippinG
Piped up in the city
Piped up with yo bitches
Piped up in Givenchy
Piped up new edition
When a nigga start talking shit, gotta pipe up the ammunition
Your bitch walking around piped up
When she see me, she blowing kisses
Feeling like Aladdin, Quavo the genie
I grant your ho three wishes
You know I do magic, Quavo Houdini
I touch the pack and get it missing

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Takeoff:]
Broke niggas still saying turn it up
All my young rich niggas screaming out pipe it up
Benjamins old they extinct like a dinosaur
Look at yo diamonds, yo diamonds ain't bright enough
I send the work to get used in a catapult
Play with the dope in the snow like a hockey puck
Pipe it up, pipe it up, no Roddy Piper
They biting the flow nigga but the Migos got the title
So now niggas dabbing, don't know how it happen
I been touchdown on you niggas ask Madden
Don't forget bitch I'm the dab daddy
In stores now YRN fabric
Pipe it up, bitch it's gong be the new anthem
I come through swerving in a black Panarama
Pull out the camo when you see me
Christian Louboutin, hopping out that's an animal
Now remember, fore we made this song, nobody said pipe it up
Next thing we dropping, we gon fuck em up
Have everybody screaming pipe it up
Pipe it up in the club while I'm on drugs
A nigga fucking up the furniture
Shoot a money ball like Steve Kerr
Pipe it up, I get them pints on reserve

[Chorus x2]@@@Gangsta Rap|||[Intro:]

They recordin', reportin' 4.5 on my dick

No information no participatin', ain't no conversation
They hatin' I made it, speculatin'
Takin' 'bout how many drugs, they fakin'

I can take you places you ain't never been
You ain't never been on that Island fucking with Gilligan
Lil mama foreign, she an immigrant
I can turn you to an American citizen
Courtside Staples watching Lakers
Big mansion, no neighbours
Bitch go back to watching basic cable
If she thinking she can play a player
Playa playa, playa playa (thinkin' she gon')
Playa playa, playa playa (nah, never)
Playa playa, playa playa (thinkin' she gon)
That bitch she think that she gon' play a player

[Verse 1 - Takeoff:]
(Takeoff)
See one thing you can't do is you can't play a player
I done did everything that you did, and I've been everywhere
She riding on Toyota, have you ever been on a Lear?
A California foreign baby, something you can barely steer
Wait hold up, that's something you can't afford
You say you want that [?], well I can lease that Porsche of course
Take her to the mall, shutdown her favorite store
Have her walking out with bags, she don't wanna shop no more
Damn, Dolce Gabbana's, Alexander McQueen, she want red bottoms
This bitch she say she want her hair just like Rihanna's
And she know daddy money longer then Rapunzel
My diamond stones cause she say she want a stoner
The way I kick it shawty thought I was a punter
Try to play me like I'm crazy, make me think that she famous
But I got one question baby, how the fuck you thinking that you gon' play a player?

No she can not play me like a Playstation
Pull up and I drop her off Atlantic Station
You know I don't want nothing but some penetration
So hit me later, tell me what's the situation
You know It's nothing
She said she never been to Atlanta now she coming
Flying from a foreign country, trying to get into something
Really she don't know nothing, can't play a player
Baby girl I want you on the northside, welcome to my world
Then why the hell she so mad then
She ain't got nothing but a little back end
She hop in the front of the Bentley coupe
And she give me brain that's frontin'
Her phone ring, she hop out my Bentley like her grandmama was calling
I ain't seen her since then, and she still keep calling
Can't play a player
They say she got a man, keep her shopping out on Rodeo
I'm a let him do it, I ain't gonna spoil her, I'm a player
No not gon' sell no dream, this ain't no fairy tale
They say that you cuffing her, nigga you working for 12

I'm a player, bitches calling me Bill Bellamy
She want my formula, can't give away my recipe
Italy, Hawaii, Beverly, it don't even matter to me
I'm on the road every day, somebody come call for me
The rings, the chains, the bezels, you ain't even on my level
Gotta fit you in my busy schedule
I can help you get your life together, I'm flyer than a feather
In any weather, I'm a player
We can swap these bitches out nigga and trade them
I've never been the cuffing type, I'm no lifesaver
I put a hole in your nigga, he like a bagel
I'm on the molly calling Scotty like I'm Fabo
You not a J-Lo, you a OK ho
Shut the fuck up before I beat it on my table
Number one rule of the Players Club
Never cuff a bitch that one of your partners done hit

[Hook - Takeoff:]

But I was worried 'bout the police
Runnin' from 12 in a Gucci fleece
It's a great feeling that they notice me
Came from bando to mansion to TV screen
No more trappin' no more [?]

Bentley Mulsanne pulling up in project buildings
[?] with these niggas, walkin' in the chinchilla
Ladies need to step aside, same one as the dealer
These niggas they hate me, but they can't defeat me, I know why they envy me
What a feeling, how I got a hundred million all in cash and you niggas just look at me
VVSing for from my jeweler out in Cuba

Make my momma smile
Make my grand momma proud
Now I got recognition
Same people doubted see me on television tv
Pocket watching on a nigga chick
Recognize a nigga rolex
17 years old nigga kicking doors
Couldn't even vote yet
Meditation of the mind was the greatest thing a nigga found
They recognize a nigga sound
And we didn't let the world down
Started with a brick turned it to a foundation
Turn the foundation to an empire
I'm the founder of Yung Rich Nation
And I still get recognized by my old patients
With a snaggered tooth smile he said he happy that I made it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Takeoff:]
If I got the feeling that I weren't recognized
I know I'd still be recognized in momma's eyes
I'm in the trench coat for the skies
I keep the 45 on my waistline
Shoot your block down with the Glock like a alpine
Fuck it shoot the club up call me shine
These Balmains no Calvin Kleins
Flood my neck with that gold like Busta Rhymes
That Migos on the billboard worldwide we recognized
A lot of these niggas wanna be recognized
But these... jammed up not gonna do the time
I know some niggas they got acquitted
And they didn't want tell and get crucified
I'm smoking on OG it ease my mind
Need some Visine cause I got the red eyes
Ain't thinking bout a bitch I'm getting money cause these bitches come and go like
Now I'm recognized taking trips in my lamb I own it no enterprise
Looking at niggas can't be mad at niggas cause niggas just want to be recognized

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Offset:]
Momma said recognize God
I recognized then momma had pain in her eyes
Though I walked through the shadow, the valley of death
I'm addicted to drank and I can't even help it lean, lean, drank, drank
Pussy nigga taking selfies
Ask me for money I told that nigga no he go round the hood saying I'm selfish huh?
That's the reason that I left him
Your momma keep calling say help
She didn't recognized you were a failure
I wanted to be recognized
Went to the mall and bought me a 10 and told the school it caught me five
My OG taught me to be wise
Thanking the lord cause I'm recognized
VH1 you can go see it live
Now you see me shining now you want to ride skrr
They finally recognized
They copy the way we rhyme

[Chorus]@@@See What I'm Saying (Intro)|||I'm having a problem
They copy the flow and they really think they out rapping me
This shit is a tragedy
So many rappers I used to look up to take after me

Then they get back to me, It keep coming back to me that we created a dynasty

See what I'm saying? (See what I'm saying)
See what I'm saying? (what, huh?)

Man I'd never know what I'd do without them

See what I'm saying? (See what I'm saying)
See what I'm saying? (what, huh?)
See what I'm saying? (See what I'm saying)

Got a dirty rifle sitting by the holy Bible cause the game is dirty like a dirty tower

Surrounded by killers and non of you cowards
I'm eating up rappers like Golden Corral

See what I'm saying? (see what I'm saying)
See what I'm saying? (huhh)

Walk in the kitchen you think I cook pasta (cook it up, cook it up)
Nigga who shot ya, fuck with the squad and won't know who got ya

King of the jungle

When I came in with Versace they calling me Quavo Big Poppa
When I came in told em' bando and taught em' how to whip a [?]

Money to blow and got money to waste
Money to count and got money to make
Young rich nigga, put a stack on my plate

I have been through the jungle and forest, came out with no scar
Remember the day at momma house sleep
Quavo woke me up in my sleep
Had one Jordan on his feet
We tripping, looking out for the police
He said not only did I lose my shoe, lost my ID
Take you back about a year ago, trapping it at the bando
Way before niggas begin using the Migos flow
When my pockets was hurting I had to kick a door
Or found a way to get benjamins was the motto
I go to sleep, I was dreaming about hitting the lotto
Wake up in reality, he gotta get every dollar
You told me to give it up, but watch how you gone' follow
Niggas that talking they gone' holla
Brush the dirt off my collar
Get back to the guala
Yea niggas, still jugg season (you forgot)
Errbody' know we got no label (independent nigga)
We came in as young rich niggas
One man down but nobody can replace him (Offset)

All my niggas keep an arm, or a 15
In the cut, that's where you get your charm up
Bet I hold a Roogger, but I got an Uzi
If you run up on me, chopper, it do ya
My niggas don't play soccer, so we don't like to kick it
My niggas play with calculater numbers and them tickets
My niggas keep the Carbin, birds singin just like Marvin

Aye yo' name must be Ray Allen or somethin'

Fuck yo' game; I got wrist game

[Hook: Quavo x2]
I just bought a Bentley wit' my wrist game
Earn my plug trust wit' my wrist game
Fuck a calculator, I got wrist game
Built a house wit' cocaine wit' my wrist game

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Built a house wit' cocaina I'm livin' like a eskimo
Pull up on Tito, he posted at the local corner store
He need a half a bag, remixin' wit' half a swag
Don't hit my phone, won't talk to you, no need to call me back
Whip game, hurricane, feelin' like Bruce Wayne
Ice chain from Johnny Dang, diamonds kickin' like Liu Kang
Naked bitches in the kitchen sniffin' off of dishes
Got them Thanksgiving turkeys, Quavo sellin' whole chickens
Servin' patients like a clinic, runnin' bands up at Lenox
Quavo President Clinton, selling Monica Lewinsky
I might pull up on you wit' the birds in that 'Rari engine
When them plays come my way, I might catch it like a mitten

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
When you got wrist game you can get anything
Gold chains, bought my index a Versace ring
So much coke in my trap spot, the pot's hot
Money jumpin' out my shoe box like Jack Box
Bitches whippin' in the kitchen, bra and panties off
Never think 'bout juugin' cause they know I cut they fingers off
Catch me in Bahamas in Versace sandals
Takeoff got that A-1 dope whip game, Mrs. Campbells
(Flats) in my panorama, watch me change the channels
All these damn babies, use saran for the pampers
Change my name to Tetris cause I got so many blocks
In the trunk I got two blocks I might just pull up on yo' block

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Offset]
My whip game it is so crazy get them bricks from them boys in Haiti
Cocaine and water create it, in the kitchen I'm making them babies
Yo' closet filled wit' Old Navy, my closet filled wit' old babies
I'm whippin', I'm whippin' them pots in the kitchen, you know I be gettin' I'm flippin' them benjis
Run wit' the pack then I'm cuttin' yo' throat, before I buy coke, I gotta get quote
Breads by the loads, bring 'em on boats, I fly overseas I'm doin' the most
No lie, I will take a o, finesse the plug, it's time for a toast
I started wit' 'bows and started wit' grams and now I'm sellin' them wholes
I feel like John Gotti, them bricks in my Masi
Let's have a trap party, I'm bringin' iCarly
They think that I'm surfin', my dope is so gnarly
Lil' Daryll whip, my dope is retarded
The feds keep talkin', they say I'm a target
I'm slam dunkin' bricks they call me Amar'e
You know I got bucks but not from Milwaukee
It's never a drought, it's bricks on the market

Huh, turn the headphones up
I mean just a- yeah, yeah, you good
Let me turn these lights off
Let me fire up this cookie real quick
You know how we get it
Can’t find my lighter though
Migos
Young rich niggas
Young niggas been doing real boss shit
They know where they got this shit from
Came in the game kicking doors, fucking hoes, and rocking gold
Now our pockets swoled
Been having hoes
Been having niggas on go
For real
Ask about it

[Verse 1 - Quavo:]
I’ma put on for my city
You gon’ put on for these bitches
Young nigga I came from nothing
And now I’m at parties with Diddy
See at first they didn’t believe me
Now this shit coming way too easy
I’m with a paid assassin
Run to the money, we dashing
We the ones came up with dabbing
We put ‘em on trap fashion
I made a play out in Athens
I’m whipping up Kylie Kardashian
Same niggas see me having
Used to be the same niggas laughing
Now my palm itching
Now my palms itching
Came from bomb pitching
My mama be the witness
Free my convicts
That took a long sentence
All my niggas came from the north, they born menace
Ay, ay, no Kanye
I walk in the trap, play with yay
Bao, bao, ra-ra-rao watch what you mu’fuckers say
Call up the lean, pour an eight
Then pour an eight, tray tray
Then I fill a Backwood, the cookies it came from the Bay
Bitch, I came from the trap
Take her phone, she wanna snap
I don’t get no sleep, I just take naps
I look out the peep, 12 at the trap
I look out my peep, 12 at the trap
Ay, my nigga gon’ run with that sack
Ay, my nigga gon’ flex on that pack
I jump out the window then forty yard dash
That’s the shit I used to do in the past
Now we through playing, we playing with cash
Chopping my top, get your top out the ash
Wrestle with work like my name Kevin Nash
Let me take it back just for two minutes
Fourteens and the nines, had tools in it
And you notice that it didn’t have windows
That the first fucking million dollar bando

[Verse 2 - Takeoff:]
Takeoff!!
Some niggas came in the game dashing but Migos you know we came in with the fashion
Ain’t talking ‘bout the Nutella but we the most underrated rappers reppin’ and havin’
My niggas have a 30 plus a 30 in the vicinity literally (so that’s a 60)
I would give you names of these Migos clones but it’s every rapper in the industry
And they wanna know why we pressing these niggas, they don’t let us in they facility
Cause if you ask me I feel like I should get a percentage the way they be stealing me
Elmo, these niggas they tickle me
Drink codeine and trap out the embassy
Mama said niggas’ll envy me
Behind the lot shootin’ at my enemies
Quavo got Kylie, well I got that Kimberly
Drinking codeine, I move slow like a centipede
We brought that flow back when niggas didn’t know
Compared Migos to Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
I put my blood sweat and tears in the game
And I still got more years so I bet they’ll remember me
All of these niggas they trying to rap nowadays
When I start spitting I ball cause it’s inner me
Remember taking trips in the Infinity
Looking for gold, electronics, or Benjamin’s
(hot, hot) the block is sizzling
Gotta stay low key cause witnesses snitching
Who the fuck told ‘em north side wasn’t the trenches
These niggas bitches, they want some attention
Niggas get put in detention
It ain’t my fault, nigga, it’s your decision
No presents up under your christmas tree
Cause I am the Grinch, stole christmas
Wonder why your children not watching Disney
Cause Migos we making a history
Bought twenty pints of Activis, you think I’m sellin’ em, but it’s just for me to sip it
If you don’t believe me you can ask Quavo, matter fact Offset was right there with me

[Verse 3 - Offset:]
Offset!!
History repeat itself, I got locked up again
I came home to the Benjamin’s
As a young nigga they always envied me
You copy my dab, you lil niggas are mini-me’s
My necklace it cost me a brick a piece
Fuck the bitch so good I make the bitch’ knees week
Dropped the top off the Bentley, it’s up to me
I sat on a milly while I was in custody
Picked up my stick, hundred rounds in my clip
Double cup of Actavis, I pour a couple zips
I’m that same nigga that jumped in the VIP
Lot of niggas pussy ‘cause they know that I’m a killer
Made a couple million, but the bricks up in the rental
We was in the bando, trapping, capping, I remember
I really beat the nigga, caught a pussy nigga stealing
Get hit with that stick and I bet you gon’ feel it
Pull up in Maseratis, where my ceiling
I see a nigga plotting, where my semi
I can whip me up a brick in a minute
Throw on Margiela one day, then Givenchy
Got the game in submission, your bitch in my kitchen
Don’t care ‘bout no ho cause that money my mission
Chill Will want a body, his finger been itching
And my Ferrari got bricks by the engine
Don’t fuck with no rappers, these fuck niggas bitches
I’m not being friendly, I don’t want to kick it
Didn’t write no letter, you niggas ain’t visit
I took a plea, I said fuck it, I did it
YRN 2, nigga listen up, hear it
We back on our shit, you can’t fuck with us period
I see a million when I’m in the mirror
Get hit with the Glock and I scrape off the serial
Hop in the Lamb, hit the gas, hit the gear
I got a shooter with me, he right here
I got your bitch suck my dick, on my leer
Police be watching me like a premiere
Put that lil bitch on some molly
She ride on my dick like a trolley
All of my cars are exotic
Knock a nigga off, don’t get indicted

Pipe up this bitch
If she is basic I pipe up your bitch
Make it dark in this bitch
Don’t worry cause I got some light on my wrist
Want to talk about dabbin’
The difference between us and them, we created that shit
Stackin’ money ever since
If it ain’t about money it don’t make sense
Dope in the troop and it’s two percent tint
Dope in the coochie, young pimp in this bitch
Keep it 100, I’m sick of this bitch
Never ate breakfast but eat out the grits
Hold that bitch down but she can’t get the stick
Taking a trip, I’ma give her the dick
Chew it up, eat it up like it’s a Twix
Most of these niggas not, they counterfeit
Go see your jeweler my nigga, you tripping
Your diamonds so little that they got me squinting
I forgot to mention you tryna get a verse from me
Then I’m gonna have to charge you a ten
Then I go 24 karat my kitchen
Fell asleep on drank at the house party with Diddy
Who the fuck said we ain’t plugged in the city

This my propaganda, riding ‘round Atlanta
I see a hundred cameras, doing shows in Alabama
I’m not your average rapper
Come to my trap, I’ll tax ya
My diamonds came from Africa, like Michael Blackson
I spent 10k in Magic, two bitches fucked my fashion
They think because I’m rapping, Houdini won’t do magic
Working the water, Atlantic
Money stretched out to Kansas
Big body panoramic
I told your bitch to get the dancer
Shoot a nigga, hit the canvas
Get off my grass like I’m Stanley

Look at my diamonds, they wink and say peek-a-boo
I shock the block like I’m Pikachu
I shot the Glock, tried to kill a few
I put that dope in her dookie chute
We fuck these bitches, we switch-a-roo
I had to beat it like Michael do
I get the Sprite and I spike a deuce
I create flames when I’m in the booth
Wide, body, I’m bout to buy me an island
Dab, stylish, these not on the shelf, you can’t find ‘em
Ice, blind ‘em, if I’m eyeing it told you I’m buying it
We together, we never divided
Like a feather I’m flier than pilots
Chew my dab up just like it is Trident
Kept it real with you niggas, we tried it
Got to hit hard and move silent
If it’s bout the money then I’m riding
If you broke, need a job, I can hire you
Offset, your dab is expiring
Your pockets ain’t straight, need alignment
The bando is my type of environment@@@You Wanna See|||[Hook - Quavo:]
Your ho wanna fuck, I don’t want her
Popped a perc and I’m geeked in Aroma
You rented it, I’m the owner
Took your ho cause she gave me a boner
Look at my dab persona
In the trap I serve a stoner
My niggas came from the corner
I got the birds, they sing like the Jonas
Eating up rappers, they boneless
I’m finna pull up right on ‘em
I’m finna pull up right on ‘em
Spraying at all my opponents
Birds they sing like the Jonas
Feeling like Don Corleone-in’
We hear that you plotting, we on it
I call my nigga to dump him

[Verse 1 - Quavo:]
Trapping, wrapping up the fungus
My niggas came from nothing
Really I came from the country
In the city got it bunking
Really she gon’ get some money
Really that ho up to something
You can really smell me ‘fore I’m coming
Cause Quavo got a whole onion
I used to trap out the ounces
You say you got checks and they bouncing
I make a public announcement
I’m having bricks in all of my houses
I make a public announcement
I’m getting money while you niggas lousy
Shoot a nigga with a rocket like Lowry
Wipe a nigga’s nose like I use Bounty
Quicker picker upper, you a sucker
Cut his body up then drop it in the bowl (cut it)
I got a white ho speaking Russian
Sad to say you niggas drinking ‘Tussin
Give me my dab, I’m taking custody
Hop out the Lam and start bustin’
You want your ho back but she stuck to me
RIP Mike and Pistol Pete
New to you, but it’s old to me
Walking in flames, I can’t see my feet
All of you niggas want to be like me
The radio sounding like mini-me’s
Take a knee, you need to honor me
K I N motherfucking G
Migo gang, we an army
Pull up on me if you want to see

[Hook - Quavo:]
Your ho wanna fuck, I don’t want her
Popped a perc and I’m geeked in Aroma
You rented it, I’m the owner
Took your ho cause she gave me a boner
Look at my dab persona
In the trap I serve a stoner
My niggas came from the corner
I got the birds, they sing like the Jonas
Eating up rappers, they boneless
I’m finna pull up right on ‘em
I’m finna pull up right on ‘em
Spraying at all my opponents
Birds they sing like the Jonas
Feeling like Don Corleone-in’
We hear that you plotting, we on it
I call my nigga to dump him

[Verse 2 - Offset:]
Feelin’ like a million
Drinking Don Pérignon
Started out pitching bombs
Buying houses for our moms
I’m thanking god today
We had a harder way
I’m on a bar today
I’m whippin’ up Mary and Kate
Sipping on drink to the face
I don’t even know what I ate
We do not go out on dates
I’ma just fuck the ho’s face
YRN, [?] with the bass
I got an M in my safe
I got a stick to be safe
She wanna give me some face
Hop in that ‘Rari and race it
I got some molly, I taste it
28 bitches, they naked
28 bitches, ain’t basic
On the north side where we based at
Roll up a Backwood and face that
Strike on the dash, I just raped ‘em
Beat on my chest, I just aped ‘em
She wanna go to Aroma
Do what I say cause I own her
Chanel perfume all on you

I call my niggas to stick ‘em up, give it up
Shaking like a stripper, tighten up
Migos Wikipedia, you can type it up
Bigger than Look At My Dab and Pipe It Up
Skating on ice but I’m not with the Mighty Ducks
When I pour they say I pour too much
Who the fuck said they get high as us?
Yung Rich Nation, who be fly as us?
These niggas drinking on Robitus’
Give ‘em the bubble gum, serving detention bus
I put that bitch on the pork, she can’t get enough
Got these bitches playing double dutch
Put that dick in her mouth, tell her pucker up
Catch you biting the dab, you get sucker punched
After I fuck that bitch once, then punt
Ain’t no going out for lunch
I told these niggas ‘bout whipping and flipping these chickens
They say I ain’t give ‘em none’
I gave these niggas the flow that they using
And niggas they act like I owe ‘em some’
My plug he just touched down in Lebanon
He teach me the gas like he Farrakhan
When you see 12 you supposed to run
Ain’t no James Bond, got the golden gun
Tonight we gon’ fuck up Aroma
Leave that and walk into Mansion
Go grab a chicken, plus some cheetahs
Or fuck it, I might go hit Magic
Big booty thot, she was a pornstar
Rose gold collection for the rose bar
Now I might black out and talking ‘bout [?]
My double cup filled with that bar

Remember back then on the North side 50 bands in the suitcase
Free my big brother Kobe
That's the only nigga that threw me the 10k
We were so hot we could sizzle
Now I'm so cold like a blizzard
You think my life was a riddle
Till I send my niggas go and get them
I do this shit for my dawgs
We used to kick doors and all
Now we fuck hoes and ball
Now we fuck hoes and ball

They said it was called the trap

Yeen’ know

All my niggas turn to Rambo or commando
We the first ones that came up with the bando
Talking ‘bout you got the Act but what they goin’ for
I’m bout to start extorting niggas for that Migo flow
We the ones that really came in with the kicking doors
Same niggas brought Versace to the centerfold
Take off on the plug, I hit him with the finger roll
If you can buy the car then why the fuck you rent it for
All of my niggas they ready to get you and hit you and flip you
And never leave no witnesses to see you
And if you, thinkin’ ‘bout calling your mommy, your daddy, your brother, your sister
That chopper hit you, having a seizure
I been teaching niggas lingo like I’m a teacher
Mamacita, she looking like a picture of Mona Lisa
Fucked ‘em up with the dab, so we goin’ up on the feature
All of my bitches they piped up and conceited

[Verse 1 - Takeoff:]
Ta-Ta-Takeoff
All rose gold on, call it Rose Bowl
I got the key and the game on lock like a cheat code
Fuck a bad bitch, I’m fucking with the fleek hoes
And I’d never give my soul up for a bankroll
Niggas get lucky standing right there by the rainbow
No rain though, I’m in the Yung Rich Nation raincoat
Good aim though, that red dot right up at your Kangol
Looking in my DM and I see your main ho
You know we the ones that came up with the bando
Them boys talking ‘bout the boards on the windows
When you trapping keep a shooter at the front door
Fuck, 12!, running out the back door
The ring on my pinky is bigger than a globe
Skippa Da Flippa done flipped a nigga, never fold
Piping up in front of your bitch, you get elbowed
Ping pong, hit a nigga with the ring on
Yung Rich Nation jeans on, it’s your theme song
So many pints in my crib, it’s a lean home
I’m so high I just need a wall to lean on
Phone home, get so stoned when we gone
Cookie smoking, the ozone, rich snowcone
Mink, it cost five, I leave the coat on
Bitch time to get your roll on
Clap a nigga with the Ric Flair robe on
Hold on

Semi-automatic out the window of the Caddy
I know this shit is tragic, toss your bitch up like a salad
Walk up in the Mansion, I just made a money pilin’
Trappin’ out the bando, selling crack up in the alley
I sent my young niggas, I got Foo with the tool
Contemplating should I drop a four or drop a deuce
Heard you a real slick looking for a good lick
But my niggas ain’t going for the bullshit
I got the stick, nigga don’t trip
Nigga run up in your house and tying up your bitch
Boot up that bitch in the morning on grits
J’s at the bando in the morning, got to fix
I’m sitting on the pedestal, my diamonds look impeccable
Your bitch sucking my dick just like an edible
Make her take a physical like medical
Fucking bitches over, she like it’s a miracle
You niggas don’t even know I got some pain in me
Missing my grandma, wish she could sing to me
A lot of dirt I did, I got some shame in me
When I’m pulling up I drop the brain on it
Came in the game with the fashion statement
We dropped Versace, the fame it came quick
Got to stay focused, consistent, don’t quit
Brick on my wrist and it make me a lick

Hit a nigga with the throwaway
Bitch I came from another place
Unfortunately we couldn't beat the case
Fuck it we outta jail anyway
You want the Migo gang? You got to pay
Kickin' in doors for the 10k, 14k, anything
Young nigga cashin' out for the change
I already dreamed that I had the fame
Red and white coupe like a candy cane
Pop a perc, it feel like Bruce Wayne
Chop a brick like I'm Tsung Shang
Bitch I'm dabbin' in my own lane
Choke, slam a nigga, Quavo Kane
I hate a nigga tryna cook plain
Cause my money taller than a great dane
We gave the world, dab fever check
My receipt is thousand dollar sneakers
Stop and get a play from cheetah
Quavo Derek Jeter, keep a street sweeper
I'm a salt water alligator eater
I play with water, you can check the meter
Cookie bag, damn I toss the reefer
Migo gang, aka grim reapers

[Hook - Quavo:]
Try the squad, nigga shots fired
Thugger daughter motherfuckin' tired (my niece)
Baby bottles, ain't no babies cryin' (drank)
Hit 'em if he cross the gun line
You holdin' yours? I'ma bust mine
He lookin' wrong, call it sus time
Free my niggas, give 'em phone time
Skin a nigga like a pork rind
We get to the money in short time
Watch us make it back 10 times
My wrist spinnin', I'm so fuckin' tired
That my favorite line of motherfuckin' tired
Chop a brick like a samurai
We the niggas make the birds fly
Then I fucked the bitch five times
Then I took her out cause I'm fuckin' tired

[Verse 2 - Takeoff:]
Takeoff!!
Just fucked a model bitch five times
I just ate a burger from Five Guys
I'm smokin' on cookies from high time
You smokin' with [?] outside
Migo gang, we have them mob ties
Put a fuck nigga on Fox 5
Pretty little bitch with her mouth wide
She see me pull up in that, frog eyes
Your bitch is 30 on the beat
Keep a 30 by my side
My bitches on fleek, Louboutin they feet
Ain't no question my niggas gon' ride
Ain't talkin' bout Drexler
When they come to that dope, nigga, I bet it's gon' glide
Ain't talkin' bout Dexter
Cook in the laboratory, [?] friends on my eyes
Remember my pockets win the [?]
So every check gotta pay my tithes
Nigga tellin' lies just to cut time
My nigga you see 'em televised
No matter how hard I try
When I put music out I'm still gon' get criticized
Nigga fuckin' round with squad
Think they wanna get decapitized

[Verse 3 - Offset:]
I'm tired.... I'm tired
These niggas flexin'
They talk about diamonds, they do not got VS inside 'em
I hit a lick, we divided it
Porsche with the gator inside of it
I'm on three Percs and I'm out of it
She gonna suck me up privately
I was young when the trap game adopted me
Grabbed the stick and shot his abdomen
Young nigga I am an arson
I got the pump in the cut with the carbon
My wrist cost a motherfuckin' 'Rari
I am a boss, I pull strings like Atari
You out of season, you need Lawries
Pull up in Beamers but trap out a Taurus
Look at the brick on my wrist look like Mick
When I got famous I darkened my tint
She took a mile when I gave her an inch
Won't sell my soul for some cash or a bitch
Hop in the plane and we land in Berlin
Christian Dior my bitch and her friend
[?] when I was in the pen
Prayin' to God that I don't go again

Yeah
Migos
Bars, bars, bars, 16 bars
16, (laughs) 16
I don’t know

[Verse 1 - Quavo:]
You take the deuce of that yellow then drink it
I be like, “Damn, boy!” what is you thinking?
When I hit Henn' bitch fuck it, I’m swinging
Walk in the Nawf, you know that they banging
(You know I got to pull up on the Nawfside one time)
Dope boy mentality, dope boy mentality
Walk in the kitchen, I make a fatality (finish him)
I feel like Takeoff, yeah we moving to Canada
Cause I still feel like people be after us (12!)
I got the chopper don’t challenge us
White girl, she geeked off of angel dust
Boy you sugar and spice, like a Powerpuff
Shoot a nigga like a catapult
You tell me you broke; I don’t give a fuck
I fuck her one time and I’m sick of her
Perform at the Fox, no Vivica
Get that pack out the box on the Reebok
When you get the dope and it’s recooked
You talking about something that he took
The first time you shot, it was off a little bit
Then you came back and got rebooked
Twenty-four karat, all gold on my neck, you think I got it from Egypt
If dabbing go for a contagious disease, you think that shit was the measles
Everything foreign, everything foreign, came a long way from that regal
I got the birds, like an eagle
Traded away, that’s a Michael Vick eagle
You just worry about yours
I’ma just worry about mine
Shout out to my nigga, Jerz
We used to trap nicks and dimes
I don’t drink, but I still buy pints
Hundred thousand cash make your hoe faint
Drugs and money is something we talk about all the time, but you can relate
Don’t imitate, the dab I create
I’m in YRN clothing or in Bathing Ape
Niggas be saving up for a lifetime just to
Get a new rollie and go out and skate
Billionaire looking my way I’m on pace
Feeling like Donald Trump back in the day
Don’t beef with no rapper it’s a money race
It won’t be an issue if you come in first place
Give it to him in the worst way
Finesse the plug with a fade away
I bought my diamonds from a Blu-Ray
I bought Versace shades from Ray
Put a ‘tato on the K
It gon’ be loud anyway
The Migos life, you think, a maze
But really, my nigga, we straight
(We straight!)

[Verse 2 - Takeoff:]
Takeoff!
Nigga we straight, no one down to debate
At the round table stacking a stack on my plate
I stack and pray and I stay out the way
It’s a good day today, I’ma pour me an eight
Grab the act out the refrigerate
Call up the plug, see what we gonna do today
Hundred-round on me, don’t speak or say “Hey”
Nigga look in my way, you get shot in the face
Dab when I jump out the Wraith
When you talk on the telephone, watch what you say
They gave them one hundred and they closed the case
Got off the [?], I threw half a mill in my safe
Transactions on trap phone, so it ain’t no trace
Don’t come out the house, you can’t make it back safe
Walk in with a knot; you know I’m cashing out
Used to tell them folks “Put your shit on layaway,”
When it’s the summer, the spring, or the fall, or the winter, my niggas they having pistols
You pushing that rental, my niggas pull up on you with them
Don’t say nothing, Domingo gone get ‘em
After you get ‘em, Domingo gon’ split ‘em
Can’t let these niggas fuck up my momentum
These bitches is snake, trying to feed me that venom
I trap out the bando; the boards come on the windows
I remember, I can’t afford a fender bender
Now I’m fucking bitches and I’m Malcolm in the Middle
I see you toting that pistol, but you ain’t gonna shoot it with ‘em
What the fuck is you doing, nigga, you might as well kill him
Niggas rapping and stealing the flow, but nigga I invented it
You bitch want some boot, and I ain’t talking about Timberland
These bitches gold diggers, ain’t gon’ give ‘em non’
Gold on my pinky, so you know she digging that
Plug in Arkansas; I call him a Razorback
Fuck what you talking about, I ain’t hearing none of that
All them niggas stick ‘em up for a 60-pack
Chopper on ‘em make a nigga do jumping jacks

[Verse 3 - Offset:]
I’m slanging tree, like I’m the lumberjack
Front me a brick, I’m running, I’m not coming back
My gas is the greatest, Mohammed Ali
Roll the backwood, it hit like a punching bag
Got the beam on the chopper, play laser tag
Cooking up M&M, wait for the aftermath
My car is robotic, my wrist is robotic
Hit the Glock and I cock it, you take a nap
I’m a Nawfside lil’ nigga, don’t fuck with no nigga
On your cheese, they put you in a mousetrap
I can’t remember the last time we had a drought
Plug up in New York, them birds flying south
We fuck these bitches and then swap ‘em out
Chopper break all your bones diagnose you with gout
Julio Jones, we running paper routes
John Wick in the cut deducing his crouch
Don’t be a fool, you get wet like a pool
Got a hot ass Uzi, cooling, keep that shit cool
In the court room represented by Jews
Hundred thousand, two hundred, working moves
When you got a pistol you go to advantage ‘em
Ready for war, ‘case a nigga get manage
Niggas see Offset; they start to go panic
They know I’m no bullshit; I’m ready to damage
I’m screaming out, “Fuck it,” my cup is still muddy
Don’t kick it with niggas; don’t play “buddy buddy”
Pussy ass nigga, you soft, Teletubby
Pulling up on you lil’ babies, like Huggies
Spanish bitch in the kitchen, mamacita
No panties on, she just got on a wife-beater
They say that the Migos better than the Beatles
We leaders, we pour an eight up in a liter
I came from the dirt; they call me the Grim Reaper
It’s cheaper to leave her; I leave her to beaver
Dabbing on them Louboutins, like a zebra
Want to know anything about the bando, I’ll teach you (Whatchu need?)@@@Hoe On A Mission|||[Hook - Quavo:]

If you wanna make millions, then join QC independent

You niggas ain't speaking my language
Ain't got a dollar you're so Brokanese
Why you niggas pocket watching
You need to be stacking that broccoli
I am the father and you are my son
I'm mister Miyagi and that's why you copy me
You niggas so broke it's killing me

The Audi, Bugatti, Ferrari, the Masi
The Bentley, the Fisker, the Jag, the Rover
With a bad bitch like Hova
My wrist it be spinning and spinning like it got a motor
Fifty bricks in the Toyota, trapping off the motorola!
Through this same time, it was last year
Migo gang still with the top, Migo gang
Niggas wasn't fucking with me
Now they wanna fuck with me
Cause they see on tv in that Versace
I know that they hate it, I know that they hate it
I know that they praying we won't make it
Momma told me, "Son, you gon be the greatest
And you know that you gon always have haters."
16 stuffing zips in my windbreaker
Hanging with the OGs and the killers
Then that windbreaker turned to a chinchilla
No limit money nigga like I signed with Percy Miller
Whippin it, whippin that Hitler then hop in that Fisker

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Offset]
It was all a dream like Biggy
Grind hard, committed, Migo gang lieutenant
Lost a lot, now we winning
From the Hondas to Bentleys
First of all I wanna say... fuck the feds
Wanna see a nigga locked up or dead
Straight up out the county, straight to the fortune
Remember back in the day broke on the porches
Smokin gas, sipping mud, driving in them Porsches
Now we traveling the world like a fucking orbit
Thousand dollars pair Giuseppes, no more rocking Jordans
Fully loaded Rolex for my son, Jordan
Now he looking up to daddy like my daddy important
Rolls Royce or the Maybach, that's boss choices
Get this shit like I'm Chuck "Offset" Norris
Rasputia my pockets they fat, don't mistake me for Norbit
WHOA!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Ever since day 1, had to juug some
Momma told me, 'better not run into these houses son"
What you mean ma? We gotta keep the lights on
She said, "Quavo you might run into the wrong one"
It was 2 years ago, it feel like it was yesterday
Task force around my house looking for a case
Turning on the channel news then I see my face
Turn myself in cause I know my lawyer beat the case
Then we dropped Bando, hoes go loco
How dare a nigga ever disrespect the Migos
Could see that hater look in the eyes, the way we hit em by surprise
Cause we blowing up like inner tube tires
Now look at my life rocking the ice, rocking the mic
Now my hoes a different color, looking like Mike & Ike
Damn right I changed my life
I hope I motivated young niggas to get their money right
Now this is for the people let em know that we some young rich niggas
Now this is for the people let em know that we got way more than one hit single
GONE!
Young Rich Niggas 2...
It's a blessing...

Pretty lil lady, lil lady
I tried to put her on but she already made it
Pretty lil lady, lil lady
And she got her own, she don't need a nigga paper
Little lady, you're so pretty
Pretty lil lady, you're so pretty
Pretty lil lady and she got her own
Pretty lil lady you know she got her own

[Verse 1 - Quavo:]
Pretty lady, she got her own Mercedes
And she single, she thick and grown with no babies
I really wanna take little mama home and go crazy
But she won't let me, I can't do nothing but respect it
She know the work from Monday through Thursday she earned it
She don't care about my money, I sip my tea like Kermit
She don't care bout them hunnids she pull em out the purses
Yo bitch I'm the dab king I fuck her like a virgin?
She say she got a 9-5 I know that bitch serving
It's none of my business I ain't worry
But if you got a nigga and you working for him
I'm a shoot that nigga, Quavo Stephen Curry

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Offset:]
Handle your business don't put me in it
I know the truth you not innocent
She got excited by my Louboutins
Hop in my Lambo fuck her, we don't speak again
She didn't know I was a rapper
Pick up the front and back in every weekend
Gotta tell the truth shawty be dabbing
Pull up on you in the jagger with Aston
Her stomach so fat like she fasting
Look at that ass it's fantastic
Go get that money lil bitty bi**h go get it
Now hop on that pole and get nasty
She won't let you smash let you spin in it
It gotta be some type of benefit
Oh fuck it I don't really need that bi**h
She a bad bi**h, she ain't really shit
I beat it, I hit her but I can not keep one
We at the condo she smoking the reefer
Some of you lie she a beater
Nasty and know little mama in the fetal
Balenciega, alligator sneakers
I trapped on the block, hotter than a fever
I know she working she is not a keeper
She fucking all these nigga's with monifa

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I know little mama she got it, no doubt about it
But I'm trying to see bout it
Pulling Benjamin's out her wallet
Looking real exotic, walking in Zanotti damn!
Big booty so big it's shaped, look like an apple ooh!
She bending over bouta make me get tackled
Wanna go to... let her see the castle
Grab bout 28 folds you gon need a ladder ooh!
We smoking up cookies burning like a candle gas
Asked her where she's from she told me Seattle
Mama live in California, said her brother doing 5 years in Savannah
Got a condo down in Alabama
She gon let me pull up be my nasty dancer beat it!
TV's in my phantom can change the channels flex
Looking up to the sky cause it's panoramic
I fuck with her pimping cause she really getting it fuck with ya
No Felicia, lil mama run up a ticket add it up
Dabbin might pull up to you in Givenchy damn!
Pretty lil lady, know she independent
You beat the statistics you got you a car and a house
So I can't take you out of the trenches, nah!

If you a street nigga you can make it rich

You not a street nigga if you got a chef and you never seen him
Get out the streets
Real street nigga tryna move out the hood to a kingdom
You not a street nigga you walking round butt naked without a pistol
You not a street nigga everybody working her
And you be kissing her
Flip the brick and bought a Fisker man
Wrist in the water like fisher man
Smuggling dope in the tin can

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Takeoff:]
You looking real amazing
I Am Legend perfect picture for an independent lady
Got me thinking bout what I'm a do to you if you pull up on me you got a nigga waiting contemplating
She said she not from the city but she been down here for a minute, used to stay in Philly
Wanna ride in a Bentley and take a trip around the city, whatever you wanna do baby I'm with it
She said What we headed to? What we finna do?
Whatever you wanna do
I said where you just came from?
She just came from a photo shoot
She ask me what's YRN
I said that mean Yung Rich Nation
That's another conversation
I'm a tell you about it just be patient
We was just looking at you looking beautiful wanna know where you come from
Telling myself can't let you walk off without Takeoff telling you sum
Rolex on your wrist a plain jane
Walk in stallion and some Balmains
Hold up baby it's just one more thing
So beautiful forgot to ask your name

[Chorus - Quavo:]
Girl you standing right there looking so amazing
Oh, I thought I'd say sum

[Verse 3 - Offset:]

Fuck it I'm bout to go say sum

What is your sign?
So is mine
All of these bitches so why you want me?
Woah, baby slow down
Aye baby, ain't gonna play
I'm attracted to the curves on your waist
When you with me you can feel safe
Your hair, nails, and your bills paid
I'm not gon leave you the wrong way
I'm not gon feed you the wrong plate
Show you manners like my momma say
You might meet my momma just one day
Tuxedo on fung-shui
Smoke a blunt in peace
Celine on her from the runway
One of one, only one may

[Chorus - Quavo:]
Girl you standing right there looking so amazing
Oh, I thought I'd say sum@@@Scooby & Shaggy|||[Hook – Quavo:]
I took his bitch, he mad at me
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
I took the plug’s package
He was like what happened
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
Scooby Doo, it was a mystery
Touchdown, going down in history
Sorry you missed me, call Scooby Doo, it’s a mystery
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically

[Quavo:]
Finessing the plug with accuracy, now he after me
Got 100 Ps in the Sprinter, nigga no athlete
And I got that chicken, no Mrs. Winners
Meet the plug at the KFC and I finesse his ass after dinner
Call me Quavo the Godzilla
Red Bentley, Forgiatos on it, call it thriller
Diamonds thrill her in Manila
Fuck her from the back, I’m facing a pillar
You pull up with choppers but are you a killer?
Mirror mirror, got a riddle for you fuck niggas
What if you get in a pickle?
If you catch a body would you tell on your peer?
If you hold it down, keep it 100, you real
Samurai sword cut the brick, Kill Bill
I trap out the mansion on Beverly Hill
RIP to Uncle Phil, fresh prince, call me Quavo Will
I know that this money a blessing
I’m thanking the lord when I kneel
We the only niggas in the city having seals
Naw, for real!

[Hook]

[Offset:]
Feeling like Marshawn Lynch in the interview, I’m thankful
Walk in the room with these trophies on my neck like you in a banquet
You acting like you really tough but you soft in the heart, you a diamond
Young nigga hopped off the porch, I was anxious
Just a young nigga old niggas embraced
Juug and finesse a nigga on my faith
Keep a little grip on my pistol, say my grace
We in the jungle, my niggas go ape
Whipping the dummy, this what I create
I fuck your bitch while you take her on dates
Nobody know I smash her on my lake
Talking fast to the plug, juuged him for 8
Stacking bricks, LA Clippers, call me Blake
Thanking the lord for my situation
Used to have bricks on the intersection
Sipping Act, daily medication
Who really real in investigations
You gonna tell because what you facing
He got out of jail and they couldn’t trace it
It’s a mystery, can’t even solve the case
Don’t be that nigga put on a plate

[Hook]

[Takeoff:]
Finesse him with accuracy
Running with the work, police tryna tackle me
Short days, long nights, trapping at the Quality Control factory
Abracadabra, work disappear magically
I’m in the kitchen whipping, it’s a tragedy
Whipping the masterpiece, then I go smoke on my balcony
My niggas and family count on me
Trapping that snow white in that van, they calling me ice cream man
I see trash bags but no trash, nigga I’m the trash bag man
I see red and white blue lights, undercover lurking in the Sedan
Start with a cutie, break it down
Bag it up, wrap it up, that was the plan
Now I’m pitching soft and curveballs
Or I can pitch it to you underhand
Remember trapping out of Camrys
Until we won Grammys
Now you niggas cannot step on my property or my grass, feel like I’m Stanly
I took his bitch, he mad at me
Fuck em fuck em, pull up on him in the alley

She lickin' my charm but I'm on the heat
The devil keep tryna come conquer me
Smokin' OG and the Fronto leaf
Droppin' a deuce in the Pure Leaf tea
I don't got time for no foolery
I'm 'bout to go drop on some jewelry
I'ma tell you lil' niggas somethin'
Fame blowin' all you niggas money
Maintain, gotta keep a hundred comin'
Ain't no pain like the name with no money
I ain't goin' out sad for her
Learned my lesson with the last whore
Throw these bitches off the backboard
I bet she fuckin' for some for some cash boy
She don't gotta know I gotta landlord
She just layin' on the land, Lord
All these niggas, they be payin' for her
Pop a perky, that's a Altoid
Niggas 'round you be a towel boy
My niggas 'round me, they some cowboys
I'll bite a nigga whole style boy
Copy the flow, give it now boy!
Do not play with the Coach K
I pull up and hop in the dirty Wraith (Ghost)
She fuck on a nigga, I fuck her face
I'm gettin' this money, I'm gettin' paid (racks)
I just bought a mansion
On the back of the banshee no panties
On my money, look, nigga demanded
Bought a mansion, the pool got expanded
Put that money on your coofie like dandruff

Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati
This is a gated community, please get the fuck off the property
Rap must be changing cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me
Niggas be wanting a verse for a verse, but man that's not a swap to me
Drowning in compliments, pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis
I think I'm sellin' a million first week, man I guess I'm an optimist
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout? Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars
Boy, Versace, Versace, we stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy
I've been so quiet, I got the world like "What the fuck is he planning?"
Just make sure that you got a back up plan cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label, the album is comin' September, just wait on it
This year I'm eating your food and my table got so many plates on it
Hundred inch TV at my house, I sit back like "damn I look great on it"
I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga, don't ask for my take on it
Speakin' in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano
Fuck all your feelin's cause business is business, it's strictly financial
